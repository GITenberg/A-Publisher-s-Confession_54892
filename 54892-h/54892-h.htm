<h2>PUBLISHERS’ NOTE</h2>

<p>There is expressed in these chapters
so much that is practical and of interest
to those engaged in the various branches
of authorship, book-making and book-selling
that the present publishers have
availed themselves of the permission of
the Boston <cite>Transcript</cite>, in which they
originally appeared, to gather them together
in book form.</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>How it Operates to the Disadvantage of Both Author
and Publisher—The Actual Facts and Figures—Authors’
Earnings Greatly Exaggerated
by the Press—Books Sell Too Cheaply—What
a Fair Price for All Concerned Would Be.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The author of a very popular book,
who has written another that will be as
popular, wishes me to publish it, so he
is kind enough to say; and he came to
see me and asked on what terms I
would bring it out. In these strenuous
times he can dictate his own terms to
his publisher; and I happened to know
that two houses had made him offers.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4">4</a></span>
I confess, since I am old-fashioned,
that this method of an author shocks
me. If he does not openly hawk his
book and his reputation, he at least
tempts one publisher to bid against
another, and thus invites the publisher
to regard it as a mere commodity. But
I suppressed my dislike of the method
and went straight about the business of
getting the book, for I should like to
have it.</p>

<p>“I will give you,” I said, “twenty per
cent. royalty, and I will pay you $5,000
on the day of publication.”</p>

<p>The words had not fallen from my
mouth before I wished to recall them,
for the publishing of books cannot be
successfully done on these terms. There
are only two or three books a year that
can pay so much.</p>

<p>“I will consider it,” said he.</p>

<p>Abject as I was, I recovered myself
far enough to say: “No, the offer is
made for acceptance now or never—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5">5</a></span>before
this conversation ends. I cannot
keep it open.”</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” I went on, for I was
regaining something of my normal courage,
“do you know what twenty per
cent. royalty on a $1.50 book means?
You receive thirty cents for every copy
sold. My net profit is about four or five
cents a copy, if I manufacture it well
and advertise it generously; and I supply
the money in advance. I make an
advance to you; I pay the papermaker
in advance of my collections, the printer—everybody;
and I wait from ninety to
one hundred and twenty days after the
book is sold to get my money. My
profit is so small that it may vanish and
become a loss by any misadventure,
such as too much advertising, the printing
of too large an edition, or the loss of
an account with a failed bookdealer. I
have no margin as an insurance against
accidents or untoward events. I am
doing business with you on an unfairly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
generous basis. I am paying you all the
money that the book can earn—perhaps
more than it can earn—for the pleasure
of having you on my list. If I make
money, I must make it on books for
which I pay a smaller royalty.”</p>

<p>“But I can get twenty per cent. from
almost any other publisher,” he replied,
truthfully. “Why should I consider
less from you?”</p>

<p>I could not answer him except by
saying:</p>

<p>“Yes, I am not blaming you—not
quite; but there is a grave fault in the
system that has brought about this general
result. You may have forgotten
that this high royalty is a direct temptation
to a publisher to skimp his advertising.
You expect generous advertising
of the book. Well, I can never sign
an order for an advertisement of it without
recalling the very narrow margin of
profit that I have. An order for $500
worth of advertising will take as much<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7">7</a></span>
net profit as I can make on several thousand
copies.</p>

<p>“Again, when I come to manufacture
the book, I cannot help recalling that
gilt letters on the cover will increase the
cost by one cent or two cents a copy.
You tempt me to do all my work in the
cheapest possible way.”</p>

<p>Well, we are good friends, this writer
and I, and we signed the contract. He
is to receive a royalty of twenty per
cent., and a payment on his royalty
account of $5,000 on the day of publication.</p>

<p>When, therefore, I had the pleasure of
receiving the friends of another author,
who told me that he would give me the
book for twenty per cent. royalty
($5,000 cash on publication) if I cared to
read it, I replied, “No.”</p>

<h3>NO MONEY ON THAT BASIS</h3>

<p>I had recovered. I said: “I cannot
make money on that basis. Neither<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8">8</a></span>
can other legitimate and conscientious
publishers, who build their business to
last. I will let novels alone, if I must.
I will do a small business—but sounder.
If that is your condition, do not leave
the book. I will pay you a sliding scale
of royalties: I cannot give you twenty
per cent.”</p>

<p>And he went away. I had just as lief
another publisher lost money on the
book as to lose it myself. True, the
public, the reading public and the writing
public, will regard the success of the
book (if it succeed) as evidence of a rival
publisher’s ability and enterprise. He
will win temporary reputation. He will
seem to be in the “swim” of success. He
will publish flaming advertisements, in
the hope of obtaining other successful
authors; and he will attract them, for
much book advertising is done not with
the hope of selling the book, but chiefly
to impress writers with the publisher’s
energy and generosity. But there’s no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9">9</a></span>
profit and great risk in business conducted
in this way.</p>

<p>There is positive danger, in fact.
And I owe it to myself and to all the
men and women whose books I publish
to see to it first of all that my own business
is sound, and is kept sound. In no
other way can I discharge my obligations
to them and keep my publishing
house on its proper level instead of on
the level of a mere business shop.</p>

<p>The rise of royalties paid to popular
authors is the most important recent
fact in the publishing world. It has
not been many years since ten per cent.
was the almost universal rule; and a ten
per cent. royalty on a book that sells
only reasonably well is a fair bargain
between publisher and author. If the
publisher do his work well—make the
book well, advertise it well, keep a well-ordered
and well-managed and energetic
house—this division of the profits is a
fair division—except in the case of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10">10</a></span>
book that has a phenomenally large
sale. Then he can afford to pay more.
Unless a book has a pretty good sale, it
will not leave a profit after paying more
than a ten per cent. royalty.</p>

<p>Figure it for yourself. The retail
price of a novel is $1.50. The retail
bookseller buys it for about ninety
cents. The wholesale bookseller buys it
from the publisher for about eighty
cents. This eighty cents must pay the
cost of manufacturing the book; of selling
it; of advertising it; must pay its
share towards the cost of keeping the
publisher’s establishment going—and
this is a large and increasing cost; it
must pay the author; and it must leave
the publisher himself some small profit.
Now, if out of this eighty cents which
must be divided for so many purposes,
the author receives a royalty of twenty
per cent. (thirty cents a copy), there is
left, of course, only fifty cents to pay all
the other items. No other half-dollar<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11">11</a></span>
in this world has to suffer such careful
and continuous division! I have met
a good many authors who have never
realized that a ten per cent. royalty
means nearly twenty per cent. on what
the publisher actually sells the book for,
and that a twenty per cent. royalty is
nearly forty per cent. on the actual
wholesale price.</p>

<p>There are several things of greater
importance in the long run to an author
than a large royalty. One of them is the
unstinted loyalty of his publisher. His
publisher must have a chance to be generous
to his book. He ought not to feel
that he must seek a cheap printer, that
he must buy cheap paper, that he must
make a cheap cover, that he must too
closely watch his advertising account.
A publisher has no chance to be generous
to a book when he can make a profit
on it only at the expense of its proper
manufacture. The grasping author is,
therefore, doing damage to his own book<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
by leaving the publisher no margin of
profit.</p>

<h3>THE STABILITY OF THE PUBLISHER</h3>

<p>There is still another thing that an
author should set above his immediate
income from any particular book; and
that is the stability of his publisher.
The publisher is a business man (he has
need to be a business man of the highest
type), but he is also the guardian of the
author’s property. If his institution be
not sound and be not kept sound, the loss
to the author in money and in standing
may be very great. The embarrassment
or failure of a publishing firm now and
then causes much gossip; for a publishing
house is a center of publicity. But nobody
outside the profession knows what
practical trouble and confusion and loss
every failure or financial embarrassment
costs the writing world. The normal
sale of many books is stopped. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13">13</a></span>
authors lose in the end, and they lose
heavily.</p>

<p>Every publisher who appreciates his
profession tries to make his house permanent,
with an eye not only to his own
profit, but also to the service that he
may do to the writers on his list. If it is
of the very essence of banking that a
bank shall be in sound condition and
shall have the confidence of the community,
it is even more true that a publishing
house should be sound to the
core and should deserve financial confidence.
The publisher must do his
business with reference to a permanent
success. But if he must do business on
the basis of a twenty per cent. royalty,
he takes risks that he has no right to
take. It deserves to be called “wildcat”
publishing.</p>

<p>I am, therefore, not making a plea, by
this confession, for a larger profit to the
publisher in any narrow or personal
sense. Every successful publisher—<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14">14</a></span>really
successful, mind you—could make
more money by going into some other
business. I think that there is not a
man of them who could not greatly increase
his income by giving the same
energy and ability to the management
of a bank, or of some sort of industrial
enterprise. Such men as Mr. Charles
Scribner, Mr. George Brett, Mr. George
H. Mifflin, could earn very much larger
returns by their ability in banks, railroads
or manufacturing, than any one
of them earns as a publisher; for they
are men of conspicuous ability.</p>

<p>It is, therefore, not as a matter of
mere gain to the publisher that it is important
to have the business on a sound
and fair basis; but it is for the sake of
the business itself and for the sake of the
writers themselves.</p>

<h3>AN AUTHOR’S BLUNDER</h3>

<p>Here is a true tale of a writer of good
fiction: He made a most promising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15">15</a></span>
start. His first book, in fact, caused him
to be sought by several publishers, who
do not hesitate to solicit clients—a
practice that other dignified professions
discourage. The publisher of his first
book gave him a ten per cent. royalty.
For his second book he demanded more.
A rival publisher offered him twenty
per cent. The second book also succeeded.
But the author in the meantime
had heard the noise of other
publishing houses. He had made the
acquaintance of another writer whose
books (which were better than his) had
sold in much greater quantities. Of
course, the difference in sales could not
be accounted for by the literary qualities
of the books—his friend had a better
publisher than he—so he concluded.
His third book, therefore, was placed
with a third publisher, because he
would advertise more loudly. Well,
that publisher failed. His failure, by
the way, the report of the receivers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16">16</a></span>
showed, was caused by spending too
much in unproductive advertising.</p>

<p>Here our author stood, then, with
three books, each issued by a different
publishing house. What should he do
with his fourth book? He came back to
his second publisher, who had, naturally,
lost some of his enthusiasm for such
an author. To cut the story short, that
man now has books on five publishers’
lists. Not one of the publishers counts
him as his particular client. In a sense
his books are all neglected. One has
never helped another. He has got no
cumulative result of his work. He has
become a sort of stray dog in the publishing
world. He has cordial relations
with no publisher; and his literary product
has really declined. He scattered
his influence, and he is paying the
natural penalty.</p>

<p>The moral of this true story (and I
could tell half a dozen more like it) is
that a publisher is a business man, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17">17</a></span>
not a mere business man. He must be
something more. He is a professional
man also. He can do his best service
only for those authors who inspire his
loyalty, who enable him to make his
publishing house permanent, and who
leave him enough margin of profit to
permit him to make books of which he
can be proud.</p>

<p>The present fashion of a part of the
writing world—to squeeze the last cent
out of a book and to treat the publisher
as a mere manufacturer and “boomer”—cannot
last. It has already passed
its high period and is on the decline. A
self-respecting worm would have turned
long ago. Even the publisher is now
beginning to turn.</p>

<p>Better still, the authors whose books
will be remembered longest have not
caught the fashion of demanding everything.
It was that passing school of
“booms” and bellowing that did it all—the
writers of romances for kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18">18</a></span>
maids and shop girls, whose measure of
book values was by dollars only. Such
fashions always pass. For, if novel writing
be so profitable an industry, a large
number of persons naturally take it up;
and they ruin the market by overstocking
it.</p>

<h3>THE “BOOMED” BOOK PASSING</h3>

<p>Fast passing, then—praise God—is
the “boomed” book, which, having no
merit, could once be sold by sheer advertising,
in several editions of 100,000 each.
I have made a list of the writers of books
that during the last five or six years
have sold in enormous editions; and
every one of these writers, but two, has
lived to see his (or her) latest book sell
far below its predecessors. One man,
for instance, wrote a first book which
sold more than 200,000 copies. His
publishers announce only the sixtieth
thousand of his latest novel, though it
has now nearly run its course.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19">19</a></span>
These are not pleasant facts. I wish
that every novelist might have an increasing
sale for every book he writes.
They all earn more than they receive—even
the bad ones whose books prosper;
but the system that they brought with
them deserves to die—must die, if publishing
is to remain an honorable profession.
They brought with them the
20 per cent. royalty, and the demand for
an advertising outlay that was based on
the sale of 100,000 or 200,000 copies.
Only the keeper of dark secrets knows
how many publishers have lost, or how
large their losses have been, on
“boomed” books. But any intelligent
business man may take the 50 cents
that the publisher receives for his $1.50
novel after paying the author’s 20 per
cent. royalty, and divide it thus:</p>

<p class="in0 in4">
Cost of manufacture,<br />
Cost of selling,<br />
Office expense,<br />
<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20">20</a></span>Extravagant advertising,<br />
Profit.
</p>

<p>If he can find anything left for profit,
then he can get rich at any business.
There have been novels so extravagantly
advertised that the advertising cost
alone amounted to 22 cents for every
copy sold. The writer drove the publisher
to loss; the publisher (foolishly)
consented in the hope of attracting
other authors to his house. If “other
authors” knew that the very cost of the
bait that attracted them makes the
publishing house unsound, they would
not long be fooled.</p>

<p>Thus it comes about, in this strange
and fascinating world of writing and
making and selling books, that one
period of “whooping up” novels is ending.
Half the novels advertised during
the past few years in big medicine style
did not pay the publishers; and any
conservative publisher can tell you
which half they are.</p>

<p>The manufacturing novelist has always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21">21</a></span>
been with us. But he used to be
an humble practitioner of the craft
whose “output” was sold for ten cents a
volume. He always will be with us, and
his product will sell, some at ten cents a
volume, some at $1.50. But the time
seems about to pass when he can disturb
the publishing situation. For the publisher
has to accept his methods when he
accepts his work; and his methods do
not pay either in dignity, permanency,
or cash. If any of these be lacking—and
in proportion as they are lacking—the
results will fall short of the ideal.
The results to be hoped for are money,
but not money only, but also a watchful
care by the publisher over his author’s
reputation and growth, and a cumulative
influence for his books.</p>

<h3>THE INCOME OF AUTHORS</h3>

<p>There are, perhaps, a dozen American
novelists who have large incomes from
their work; there are many more who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22">22</a></span>
have comfortable incomes; but there is
none whose income is as large as the
writers of gossip for the literary journals
would have us believe. It has been
said that Harper’s Magazine pays Mrs.
Humphry Ward $15,000 for the serial
right of each of her stories and twenty
per cent. royalty. Miss Johnston must
have made from $60,000 to $70,000
from royalties on “To Have and to
Hold,” for any publisher can calculate
it.</p>

<p>But along with these great facts let us
humbly remember that Mr. Carnegie
received $300,000,000 for all his steel
mills, good will, etc.; for the authors
that I have named are the “millionaires”
of the craft. I wish there were
more. But the diligent writers of most
good fiction, hard as they have ground
the publishers in the rise of royalties,
are yet nearer to Grub street than they
are to Skibo Castle.</p>

<p>The truth is—but it would be a difficult<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23">23</a></span>
task to reduce such a truth to practice—that
the public gets its good new
novels too cheap. There is not a large
enough margin of profit for author, publisher
and bookseller in a new book that
is meant to be sold for $1.50 and that is
often sold for $1.08. The business of
bookmaking and bookselling is underpaid.
There is not a publisher in the
United States who is today making any
large sum of money on his “general
trade.” Money is made on educational
books, on subscription books, on magazines.
But publishing, as publishing, is
the least profitable of all the professions,
except preaching and teaching, to each
of which it is a sort of cousin.</p>

<span class="subhead">WHY “BAD” NOVELS SUCCEED AND
“GOOD” ONES FAIL</span></h2>
</div>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>The First May Have No Literary Quality, but
They Have a Genuine Quality—Power of Construction
the Main Thing in Story-Writing—Literary
Reviews of Novels are Regarded as of
Little Value by Publishers—Odd Incidents and
Facts in the Business.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>A report on the manuscript of a novel
made by a “literary” reader not long
ago ended with this sentence: “This
novel is bad enough to succeed.” He
expressed the feeling of a great many
literary persons that fiction often succeeds
in the market in proportion to its
“badness.” And surely there are many
instances to support such a contention
from the “Lamplighter” to “When
Knighthood Was in Flower.” But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“literary” view of fiction is no more
trustworthy than the “literary” view
of politics or of commerce; for it concerns
itself more with technique than
with substance.</p>

<p>It is a hard world in which “Knighthood,”
“Quincy Adams Sawyer” and
“Graustark,” to say nothing of “The
One Woman,” “Alice of Old Vincennes”
and a hundred more “poor” books
make fortunes, while Mr. Howells and
Mr. James write to unresponsive markets
and even Mr. Kipling cannot find
so many readers for a new novel as Mr.
Bacheller of “Eben Holden.” It seems
a hard world to the professional literary
folk; but the professional literary folk
would find it a hard world anyhow; for
it has a way of preferring substance to
color. And novels, after all, have less
to do with literature than they have to
do with popular amusement.</p>

<p>Heaven forbid that I should make defence
of bad writing, or of sensational<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29">29</a></span>
literature, or of bad taste, or of any
other thing that is below grade; but, as
between the professional literary class,
and the great mass of men who buy
“Eben Holdens” and “David Harums”
the mass of men have the better case.</p>

<p>Why does a man read a novel? Let
us come down to common-sense. He
seeks one of two things—either a real
insight into human nature (he got that
in “David Harum”) or he seeks diversion,
entertainment. A writer’s style
is only a part of the machinery of presentation.
The main thing is that he has
something to present. Even though I
am a publisher I think that I know
something about literary quality and
literary values, and it must be owned at
once that hardly one in a dozen of the
very popular recent novels has any
literary quality. But every one of
them, nevertheless, has some very genuine
and positive quality. They were
not written by any trick, and their popularity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30">30</a></span>
does not make the road to success
any easier to find. They have
qualities that are rarer than the merely
literary quality. Mr. Henry James’s
novels have what is usually called the
literary quality. Yet half the publishing
houses in the United States have lost
money on them, while the publisher and
the author of “Richard Carvel” and
“The Crisis” and “The Crossing” made
a handsome sum of money from these
books, which have no literary style.</p>

<p>This does not mean a whining confession
that “literature” does not pay.
For my part I cannot weep because Mr.
James and Mr. Howells do not find many
readers for their latest books. They
find all they deserve. Mere words were
never worth much money or worth
much else. But, while Mr. Churchill is
not a great writer (since he has no style),
and while few persons of the next generation
of readers (whereby I mean
those of year after next) are going to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31">31</a></span>
take the trouble to read his books, yet,
for all that, they have a quality that is
very rare in this world, a quality that
their imitators never seem to see. They
have construction. They have action.
They have substance. A series of
events come to pass in a certain order,
by a well-laid plan. Each book makes
its appeal as a thing built, finished,
shapen, if not well-proportioned, substantial.
It is a real structure—not a
mere pile of bricks and lumber. The
bricks and lumber that went into them
are not as fine nor as good as somebody
else may have in his brickyard and his
lumber pile. But they are put together.
A well shapen house of bad bricks is a
more pleasing thing than any mere
brick-pile whatever.</p>

<p>I recall this interesting experience of a
man whose novels are now fast winning
great popular favor. He sat down and
wrote a story and sent it to a publisher.
It was declined. He sent it to another.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Again it was declined. Then he brought
it to me. (He told me of the preceding
declinations a year later). I told him
frankly that it lacked construction. I
supposed that that was the last that I
should see of him. But about a year
later he came again with another manuscript
and with this interesting story.</p>

<p>“Like a fool,” said he, “I simply
blazed away and wrote what I supposed
was a novel. Nobody would publish it.
When you said that it lacked construction,
I went to work to study the construction
of a novel. I analyzed twenty.
I found a dozen books on the subject
which gave me some help. But there
are few books that do help. I constructed
a sort of method of my own.”</p>

<p>That man yet has no sense of literary
values, as they are usually considered.
The only good quality of his style is its
perfect directness and clearness. He
writes blunt, plain sentences. But every
one of them tells something. He does<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33">33</a></span>
not bother himself about style, nor
about literary quality. He fixes his
mind on the story itself, to see that it
has substance, form, action, proportion.
And he worked out this new novel with
these qualities in it.</p>

<p>It was a dime novel in praise of one of
the cardinal Christian virtues—very
earnest, very direct. But the persons in
it were real. They not only said things,
they did things; and many of the things
they did were interesting. One of our
salesmen was asked to read the manuscript.
“It’ll sell,” said he. Our literary
adviser said that it was a bald moral
Sunday school play. “You could put it
on the stage by cutting it here and
there,” he declared. “But it has no
literary quality.” Both were right.
The book has sold well. It has amused
and interested its tens of thousands.</p>

<p>The author’s next book after that was
very much better. Having learned
something of the art of construction he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34">34</a></span>
began to think of such a detail as style.
He re-wrote the book to make it
“smooth.” But the point is, he first
paid attention to his construction and
made sure that he had a story to tell.</p>

<p>The enormous amount of waste work
done by unsuccessful novel writers is
done without taking the trouble first to
make sure that they have a story to tell.</p>

<p>Few persons have any constructive
faculty. This is the sad fact that comes
home at last to a man who has read
novels in manuscript for many years.
A publisher comes to look for construction
in a novel before he looks for style
or literary quality.</p>

<p>This confession is enough to provoke
the literary journals to condemn the
publishers as mere mercenary dealers in
sensational books. Yet, while a book
that is well constructed may not be
“literature,” very few books have a
serious chance to become literature unless
they have good construction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35">35</a></span>
I, for one, and I know no publisher
who holds a different opinion, care nothing
for the judgment of the professional
literary class. Their judgment of a
novel, for instance, is of little value or
instruction. It may be right—often it
is. It may be wrong. But whether
right or wrong (and there is no way that
I know to determine finally whether any
judgment be right or wrong) it is of no
practical value. A literary judgment
of a new novel cannot affect the judgment
that men will form of it ten years
hence. Therefore it is of no permanent
value. Neither can it affect the sales of
a new novel. It is therefore of no practical
importance for the moment. I look
upon reviews of novels as so much publicity—they
have value, as they tell the
public that the book is published and
can be bought, and as they tell something
about it which may prod the reader’s
curiosity. Further than this they
are of no account. Not one of the three<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
publishers whose personal habits I know
as a rule takes the trouble to read the
reviews of novels of his own publishing.</p>

<p>Novel making, then, is an industry,
and the people who make them best concern
themselves very little about what
is usually meant by “literary values,”
and very little about their popularity.
The writers who deliberately set out to
write novels of great popularity have
almost always missed it. The industry
is an art, also, but it is not an art of
mere fine writing. It is chiefly an art of
construction—an art of putting things
in due proportion. This assumes, of
course, that the novelist has things to
put.</p>

<p>The truth is, the delicate and difficult
art of finding out just what the public
cares for—the public of this year or the
public of ten years hence—has not been
mastered by many men, whether writers
or publishers. If you find out what
the great public of today wants, you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37">37</a></span>
a sensationalist. If you find out what
the great public of ten or twenty years
hence will want, you are a maker or a
publisher of literature. And the public
of the future is pretty sure to want
something different from the public of
today.</p>

<p>Within six months after the publication
of a popular novel the publisher of
it (other publishers, too) will receive a
dozen or a hundred stories that have
been suggested by it. Many an author
of such a manuscript will write that he
has discovered the secret of the popular
book’s success and that he has turned it
to profit in his own effort. Such letters
are singularly alike. The writers of
them regard success as something won
by a trick, as a game of cards might be
won. These remind one, too, of the advertisements
of patent medicines—except
that the writers of them are sincere.
They believe heartily in their discovery.
Thus every very popular novel gives a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38">38</a></span>
great stimulus to the production of
novels. “To Have and To Hold”
brought cargoes of young women for
colonists’ wives to hundreds of amateur
story writers.</p>

<p>But stranger than the popularity of
very popular novels, or than the utter
failure of merely “literary” novels, is
the moderate success of a certain kind of
commonplace stories. I know a woman
of domestic tastes who every two years
turns off a quiet story. She has now
written a dozen or more. They are never
advertised. But they are well printed
and put forth by one of our best publishers.
The “literary” world pays no
heed to her. Her books are not even
reviewed in the best journals. They lack
distinction. But every one is sure to
sell from ten to fifteen thousand copies.
No amount of advertising, no amount of
noise could increase the number of readers
to twenty-five thousand; and there
is no way to prevent a sale of from ten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39">39</a></span>
to fifteen thousand copies. Why this is
so is one of the most baffling problems of
psychology. But it is the rule. Authors
of novels are known and rated among
publishers as ten thousand, or twenty-five
thousand, or fifty thousand, or one
hundred thousand writers. Book after
book reaches a certain level of popularity
and—stops. Mr. Marion Crawford,
Mr. Hopkinson Smith, Miss Wilkins—all
these have their more or less constant
levels.</p>

<p>The lay world has no idea of the number
of novels that fail. There are one-book
authors all over the country. The
publishers’ hope always is that a new
writer who makes a pretty good novel
will do better next time. Thus the first
book is accepted for the sake of the next
one. The first fails, and the second is
not wanted. There are dozens and
dozens of such cases every year. The
public doesn’t know it, for the very
abyss of oblivion is the place where a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40">40</a></span>
dead novel falls. Nobody knows it—that
is the tragedy—but the publishers
and the author.</p>

<p>A case came to light a little while ago
of a man who had years ago written
novels that failed. He had been forgotten.
But he took a new start. Yet he
feared that his first failures would damn
him with the publishers. He took
another name, therefore. Not even his
publishers knew who he really was. He
succeeded and he concealed his identity
until he died.</p>

<p>The publisher’s loss on an unsuccessful
novel may be little or big. All publishers
lose much on unsuccessful ventures
in fiction, chiefly on young authors
who are supposed to have a future, or on
old authors who have a “literary” reputation
and have reached that ghostly
period of real decline when they walk in
dreams from one publishing house to
another.</p>

<p>But there is generally a reason for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41">41</a></span>
success or for failure. The trouble is
that the reason often does not appear
soon enough. The chief reason for the
success of a novel is the commonplace
one that it contains a story. It may
be told ill or it may be told well, but
there is a story. And the chief reason
for failure is the lack of a story. A novel
may be ever so well written,—if it have
no story, the public will not care for it.</p>

<p>I wonder if there be any light in this
very obvious discovery. Simple as it
seems, it costs every publishing house
a pretty penny every year to find it out;
and as soon as we find it out about one
writer we forget it about another! It is
a great truth that does not remain discovered.</p>

<p>The old and persistent notion that the
writers of books are an irritable tribe,
hard to deal with, and manageable only
by flattery—if it was ever true, is not
true now. During an experience of a
good many years I have suffered a discourtesy
from only two. Both these
were “philosophers”—not even poets,
nor novelists. They wrote books that
the years have proved are dull; and,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46">46</a></span>
when it became my duty to disappoint
them, although I hope I did it courteously,
they wrote ill-tempered letters.
The hundreds of other writers of all sorts
that I have had the pleasure to deal with
have conducted themselves as men and
women of common sense, and most of
them are men and women of very unusual
attractiveness. I doubt whether a
man of any other calling has the privilege
of dealing with persons of such
graciousness and of such consideration.</p>

<p>But the women who write require
more attention than the men. Their
imaginations are more easily excited by
the hope of success, and few of them
have had business experience. They
want to be fair and appreciate frank
dealing. Yet they like to have everything
explained in great detail.</p>

<p>One woman, now one of our most
successful novelists—successful both as
a writer of excellent books and as an
earner of a good income—was kind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47">47</a></span>
enough to seek my advice about one of
her early novels. It was a book that she
ought not to have written; the subject
was badly chosen. I frankly told her so.
The whole reading world has told her so
since. But naturally she did not agree
with me. She took the book to another
publisher. Two years passed. She had
a second novel ready. This was one of
the best American stories of a decade.
To my great gratification I received a
letter from her one day asking if I cared
to read it. Of course I said yes.</p>

<p>Then came another telling how she
had never changed her opinion of her
former book—not a jot—I must understand
that thoroughly. If that were
clearly understood she went on to say
she would like to have me publish the
new book on two conditions: (1) That
I should myself read it immediately and
say frankly what I thought of it, and (2)
that I should pay her a royalty large
enough to repair her wounded feelings<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48">48</a></span>
about the former book. Subsequently
she added another <span class="locked">condition—</span></p>

<p>“You may publish it,” she said, “if
you heartily believe in the book.”</p>

<p>Very shrewdly said—that “heartily
believe in the book.” For the secret of
good publishing lies there. There are
some books that a publisher may succeed
with without believing in them—a
dictionary or a slapdash novel, for examples.
But a book that has any sterling
quality—a real book—ought never
to have the imprint of a publisher who is
not really a sharer of its fortunes, a true
partner with the author. For only with
such a book can he do his best.</p>

<p>I did believe in this book. As soon as
it was in type I required every man in
my office who had to do with it to read
it—the writer of “literary notes,” the
salesman and even the shipping clerk.
When the author next called I introduced
to her all these. They showed their
enthusiasm. She was convinced. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49">49</a></span>
book succeeded in the market almost
beyond her expectations. It is a good
book. Everyone of us believes in it and
believes in her.</p>

<p>She is not a crank, “but only a woman.”
We have our reward in her
friendship and she is generous enough to
think that we have done her some service.
We esteem it a high privilege to be
her publishers.</p>

<p>But God save me from another woman
who has won a conspicuous success
in the market. The first question she
ever asked me was:</p>

<p>“Are you a Christian?”</p>

<p>“Do I look like a Jew or a Mohammedan?”
I asked.</p>

<p>She never forgave me. Her novel had
a great religious motive. It sold by the
tens of thousands and most maudlin
emotionalists in the land have read it.
But I do not publish it. To do so, I
should have had to pay the price of
being “converted.” Now this lady is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50">50</a></span>
a crank. But it is not fair to call her
books literature.</p>

<p>The veriest crank of all is our great
scholar. It is an honor to publish the results
of his scholarship (few parsnips as
it butters), for the man’s work is as attractive
as he is odd. He thinks himself
the very soul of fairness. Yet he comes
at frequent intervals wishing so to
change his contract as to make publishing
his books an even more expensive
luxury than it was before. A contract
is to him a thing to make endless experiments
with. When we were once
driven to desperation, one of my associates
suggested that we propose half a
dozen unimportant changes in it, on the
theory that change—any change—was
all he wanted. It was an inspired suggestion.
A great scholar, a restless
child. But some day (we feel) he will
break over all traces, and we are all afraid
of him.</p>

<p>But very sane and sensible men and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51">51</a></span>
women are most of those who succeed
in winning the public favor. Some are
grasping, as other men are. One, for instance,
whose book had earned $7,000 in
two years, demanded a prepayment of
$8,000 for the next book. A compromise
was made on $2,000! That was the
measure of my folly, for the book is
waning in its popularity and has hardly
earned this prepaid royalty.</p>

<p>An author came to my office one day
indignant because his novel was not
more extensively advertised. There was
the usual explanation—it would not
pay. He had money to spare and he
proposed to advertise it himself. He
wrote the advertisements, he selected
the journals in which the advertisements
should appear, and he inserted
them—$1,000 worth.</p>

<p>By some strange fate the sales of the
book began just then greatly to decline.
They have kept declining since, and why
nobody can tell. When the public has<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52">52</a></span>
bought a certain number of copies of a
novel—of one novel it may be 1,000
copies, of another 100,000 copies—there
is nothing that can be done to make
it buy another 1,000 or 100,000. It
seems to know when it has enough.
Take more it will not. The worst
“crank” that any publisher ever encountered
is not an author; it is the
public, unreasoning, illogical, unconvincible,
stolid!</p>

<p>Odd persons are found in every craft.
But I think that there are fewer odd ones
among successful writers than among
successful lawyers, for instance. And
this is what one would naturally expect,
but for the traditional notion that writers
are unbalanced. Who else is so well
balanced as the writer of good books?
He must have sanity and calmness and
judgment, a sense of good proportion, an
appreciation of right conduct and of all
human relations, else he could not make
books of good balance and proportion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53">53</a></span>
Most writers have few financial dealings,
and they often innocently propose
impracticable things. But this is
not a peculiar trait of writers. Most
preachers and many women show it. I
have known a successful college president,
for instance, to cut a paragraph
out of a proof sheet with a pair of scissors,
imagining that this would cause it
to be taken out by the printers.</p>

<p>They are appreciative, too; and they
make the most interesting friends in the
world. Almost all writers of books work
alone. Lawyers work with clients and
with associated and opposing lawyers.
Even teachers have the companionship
of their pupils in the work. Men of most
crafts work with their fellows, and they
forget how much encouragement they
owe to this fellowship. A dreary task is
made light by it and monotonous labor
is robbed of its weariness. But the
writer works alone.</p>

<p>Almost the first man to be taken into<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54">54</a></span>
his confidence about his work is his publisher.
If the publisher be appreciative
and sympathetic and render a real service,
how easily and firmly the writer is
won. A peculiarly close friendship follows
in many cases—in most cases, perhaps,
certainly in most cases when the
author’s books are successful.</p>

<p>And this is why a great publishing
trust, or “merger” is impossible. The
successful publisher sustains a relation
to the successful author that is not easily
transferable. It is a personal relation.
A great corporation cannot take a real
publisher’s place in his attitude to the
authors he serves.</p>

<p>This is the reason, too, why the
“authors’ agents” seldom succeed in
raising the hopes of unsuccessful writers.
As soon as a writer and a publisher
have come into a personal relation that
is naturally profitable and pleasant, a
“go-between” has no place. There is
no legitimate function for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55">55</a></span>
Writers are as constant in their relations
as other men and women. As they
acquire experience, they become more
constant. Every one for himself works
his way to this conclusion—once having
an appreciative and successful publisher,
it is better to hold to him. And the
strong friendships that grow out of this
relation are among the most precious
gains to each.</p>

<p>One publisher said to another the
other day: “I see by your announcements
that one of my authors has gone
to you—you are welcome.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the reply, “I have in almost
every instance made a mistake
when I have taken in a dissatisfied
writer—one cannot make lasting friends
with them.”</p>

<p>Every great publishing house has been
built on the strong friendships between
writers and publishers. There is, in fact,
no other sound basis to build on; for the
publisher cannot do his highest duty to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56">56</a></span>
any author whose work he does not appreciate,
and with whom he is not in
sympathy. Now, when a man has an
appreciation of your work and sympathy
for it, he wins you. This is the
simplest of all psychological laws—the
simplest of all laws of friendship and one
of the soundest.</p>

<p>Those who know the personal history
of the publishing houses that in recent
years have failed or met embarrassments
know that, in most cases, one
cause of decline was the drawing apart
of publishers and authors. When authors
begin to regard their publishers as
mere business agents, and publishers to
regard authors as mere “literary men”
with whom they have only business
relations, the beginning of a decline has
come.</p>

<p>I recall as one of the pleasantest days
of my life the day on which I accepted a
book by an author I had never before
seen. So pleasant was our correspondence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_57">57</a></span>
that I took the first occasion I
could to go nearly a thousand miles to
see him. In his own house we talked
about his literary plans, and I spent a
day always to be remembered. Our
friendship began then. Of course I was
interested in his work—you cannot long
feign an interest that you do not feel.
This friendship has lasted now long
enough to make it very much more secure
a bond than any merely commercial
service could have become.</p>

<p>Every publisher’s experience is the
same—if he be a real publisher and will
long remain a real publisher. Else he
would be only a printer and a salesman,
and mere printers and salesmen have
not often built publishing houses. For
publishing houses have this distinction
over most other commercial institutions—they
rest on the friendship of the most
interesting persons in the world, the
writers of good books.</p>

<p>The more formal cultivation of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58">58</a></span>
friendly relations such as the famous
dinners that some publishers used regularly
to give to writers has gone out of
fashion. There are yet a few set dinners
in the routine of several American publishing
houses. But every true publisher
knows the authors of his books—knows
them as his friends; and the tradition of
irritability is false. It is usually the unsuccessful
who are irritable, whether
they be authors or not.</p>

<span class="subhead">HAS PUBLISHING BECOME COMMERCIALIZED?</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>A Charge Fairly Met and Its Truths Admitted—Many
Features of the Business in Which a Low
Tone Prevails—The Literary Solicitor an Abhorrent

Commercial Degradation Prevails Less with

Confidence Authors Have in Them Is Their
Best Asset.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Authorship and publishing—the
whole business of producing contemporaneous
literature—has for the moment
a decided commercial squint. It
would be wrong to say, as one sometimes
hears it said, that it has been degraded;
for it has probably not suffered
as nearly a complete commercialization
as the law has suffered, for instance.
But that fine indifference to commercial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
results which was once supposed to be
characteristic of the great publishers
does not exist today. Perhaps it never
existed except in memoirs and literary
journals! But there was a less obvious
effort to make money in the days of the
first successful American publishing
houses than there is now.</p>

<p>The old publishing houses put forth
schoolbooks; and many a dignified
literary venture was “financed” by
money made from the sale of textbooks
and subscription books. But now the
greater part of the money made from
these two special departments is made
by houses that publish nothing else.
The making of schoolbooks and the
making of subscription books have been
specialized, and almost separated from
general publishing. Two great textbook
houses have made large incomes; and
they publish nothing but schoolbooks.
These profits, which were once at the
service of literature, are now withdrawn<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63">63</a></span>
from it. The “general” publisher has to
make all his profits on his “general”
books. The necessity is the heavier on
him, therefore, to make every book pay.
This is one reason why the general publisher
has to watch his ledger closely.</p>

<p>Another reason for greater emphasis
on the financial side of literary production
is the enormously increased expense
of conducting a general publishing
house. The mere manufacture of books
is perhaps a trifle cheaper than it used to
be, but every other item of expense has
been increased enormously within a
generation. It costs more to sell books
than it ever cost before. Advertising
rates have been doubled or trebled, and
more advertising must be done. Even
a small general publishing house must
spend as much as $30,000 or $50,000 a
year in general advertising. There are
many houses that each spend a great
deal more than this every year.</p>

<p>The author, too, it must be remembered,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64">64</a></span>
has become commercial. He demands
and he receives a larger share of
the gross receipts from his book than
authors ever dreamed of receiving in the
days of the old-time publisher. All the
other expenses of selling books have increased.
There was a time when publishing
houses needed no travelling
salesmen. Now every house of any importance
has at least two. They go
everywhere, with “dummies” and prospectuses
of books long before they are
ready for the market. Other items of
“general expense” besides advertising
and salesmen and ever-increasing rent,
are the ever-growing demands of the
trade for posters and circulars; correspondence
grows more and more; more
and more are special “window displays”
required, for which the publisher
pays. All the while, too, books are sold
on long time. As a rule they are not paid
for by many dealers till six months after
they are manufactured.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65">65</a></span>
All these modern commercial methods
have added to the publisher’s expense or
risk; and for these reasons his business
has become more like any other manufacturing
business than it once seemed
to be—perhaps more than it once was.
Of course there are publishers—there
always were such—who look only to
their ledgers as a measure of their success.
These are they who have really
demoralized the profession, and the
whole publishing craft has suffered by
their methods.</p>

<p>It was once a matter of honor that one
publisher should respect the relation
established between another publisher
and a writer, as a physician respects the
relation established between another
physician and a patient. Three or four
of the best publishing houses still live
and work by this code. And they have
the respect of all the book world.
Authors and readers, who do not know
definitely why they hold them in esteem,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66">66</a></span>
discern a high sense of honor and conduct
in them. Character makes its way
from any man who has it down a long
line—everybody who touches a sterling
character comes at last to feel it both in
conduct and in product. The very best
traditions of publishing are yet a part of
the practice of the best American publishing
houses, which are conducted by
men of real character.</p>

<p>But there are others—others who keep
“literary drummers,” men who go to see
popular writers and solicit books. The
authors of very popular books themselves
also—some of them at least—put
themselves up at auction, going from
publisher to publisher or threatening to
go. This is demoralization and commercialization
with a vengeance. But
it is the sin of the authors.</p>

<p>As a rule, this method has not succeeded;
or it has not succeeded long.
There are two men in the United States
who have gone about making commercial<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67">67</a></span>
calls on practically every man and
woman who has ever written a successful
book; and they are not well thought
of by most of the writers whom they see.
Every other publisher hears of their
journeyings and of their “drumming.”
Sometimes they have secured immediate
commercial results, but as a rule they
have lost more than they have gained.
The permanent success of every publishing
house is built on the confidence and
the esteem of those who write books.
When a house forfeits that, it begins to
lose. Its very foundations begin to become
insecure.</p>

<p>Commercial as this generation of writers
may be, almost every writer of books
has an ambition to win literary esteem.
They want dignity. They seek reputation
on as high a level as possible.
“The trouble with the whole business”
(I quote from a letter from a successful
novelist) “is that novel-writing has become
so very common. ‘Common’ is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68">68</a></span>
the word. It is no longer distinguished.
What I want is distinction. Money I
must have—some money at least; but
I want also to be distinguished.” That
is a frank confession that almost every
writer makes sooner or later.</p>

<p>Now, when a publishing house forfeits
distinction it, too, becomes common,
and loses its chance to confer a certain
degree of distinction. And literary
“drummers” have this effect—authors
who can confer distinction shun their
houses. The literary solicitor, therefore,
can work only on a low level; and the
houses that use him are in danger of
sinking to a low level.</p>

<p>The truth is, it is a personal service
that the publisher does for the author,
almost as personal a service as the physician
does for his patient or the lawyer
for his client. It is not merely a commercial
service. Every great publisher knows
this and almost all successful authors
find it out, if they do not know it at first.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69">69</a></span>
The ideal relation between publisher
and author requires this personal service.
It even requires enthusiastic service.
“Do you thoroughly believe in
this book? and do you believe in me?”
these are the very proper questions that
every earnest writer consciously or unconsciously
puts to his publisher. Even
the man who writes the advertisements
of books must believe in them. Else his
advertisements will not ring true. The
salesmen must believe what they say.
The booksellers and the public will soon
discover whether they believe it. They
catch the note of sincerity—the public
is won; the author succeeds. Or they
catch the note of insincerity and the
book lags.</p>

<p>This is the whole story of good publishing.
Good books to begin with, then
a personal sincerity on the part of the
publisher. And there is no lasting substitute
for these things.</p>

<p>The essential weakness in most of even<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70">70</a></span>
the best publishing houses of our day is
the lack of personal literary help to
authors by the owners of the publishing
houses themselves. Almost every writer
wishes to consult somebody. If they do
not wish advice, they at least wish sympathy.
Every book is talked over with
somebody. Now, when a publishing
house has a head—an owner—who will
read every important manuscript, and
freely and frankly talk or write about it,
and can give sympathetic suggestions,
that is the sort of publishing house that
will win and hold the confidence of the
best writers. From one point of view the
publisher is a manufacturer and salesman.
From another point of view he
is the personal friend and sympathetic
adviser of authors—a man who has a
knowledge of literature and whose judgment
is worth having. A publisher who
lacks the ability to do this high and intimate
service may indeed succeed for a
time as a mere manufacturer and seller<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71">71</a></span>
of books; but he can add little to the
best literary impulses or tendencies of
his time; nor is he likely to attract the
best writers.</p>

<p>And—in all the noisy rattle of commercialism—the
writers of our own generation
who are worth most on a publisher’s
list respond to the true publishing
personality as readily as writers did
before the day of commercial methods.
All the changes that have come in the
profession, therefore, have not after all
changed its real character as it is practised
on its higher levels. And this rule
will hold true—that no publishing house
can win and keep a place on the highest
level that does not have at least one man
who possesses this true publishing personality.</p>

<p>There is much less reason to fear the
commercial degradation of many other
callings than the publishers’.</p>

<p>A louder complaint of commercialism
has been provoked by the unseemly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72">72</a></span>
advertising of novels than by any other
modern method of publishers. Now this
is a curious and interesting thing. A
man or woman writes a story (let us call
it a story, though it be a mild mush of
mustard, warranted to redden the faded
cheeks of sickly sentimentality) which,
for some reason that nobody can explain,
has the same possibilities of popularity
as Salvation Soap. A saponaceous
publisher puts it out; he advertises
it in his soapy way; people buy it—sometimes
two hundred or three hundred
thousand of them.</p>

<p>Behold! a new way has been found to
write books that sell, and a new way to
sell them. Hundreds of writers try the
easy trick. Dozens of minor publishers
see their way to fortune. But the trick
cannot be imitated, and the way to
fortune remains closed. It is only
now and then that a novel has a big
“run” by this method. The public
does not see the hundreds of failures.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73">73</a></span>
It sees only the occasional accidental
success.</p>

<p>There is no science, no art, no literature
in the business. It is like writing
popular songs: One “rag-time” tune
will make its way in a month from one
end of the country to the other. A hundred
tune-makers try their hands at the
trick—not one of their tunes goes. The
same tune-maker who “scored a success”
often fails the next time. There
is, I think, not a single soap-novelist who
has put forth a subsequent novel of as
great popularity as his “record-breaker,”
and several publishing houses
have failed through unsuccessful efforts
at the brass-band method.</p>

<p>This is not publishing. It is not even
commercialism. It is a form of gambling.
A successful advertising “dodge”
makes a biscuit popular, or a whiskey, or
a shoe, or a cigarette, or anything. Why
not a book, then? This would be all that
need be said about it but for the “literary”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74">74</a></span>
journals. They forthwith fall to
gossiping, and keep up a chatter about
“great sellers,” and bewail commercialism
in literature, until we all begin to
believe that the whole business of book-writing
and book-publishing has been
degraded. Did it ever occur to you that
in the “good old days” of publishing
there were no magazines that retailed
the commercial and personal gossip of
the craft?</p>

<p>As nearly as I can make out the publishing
houses in the United States that
are conducted as dignified institutions
are conducted with as little degrading
commercialism as the old houses whose
history has become a part of English
literature, and I believe that they are
conducted with more ability. Certainly
not one of them has made a colossal fortune.
Certainly not one of them ever
failed to recognize or to encourage a high
literary purpose if it were sanely directed.
Every one of them every year<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75">75</a></span>
invests in books and authors that they
know cannot yield a direct or immediate
profit, and they make these investments
because they feel ennobled by trying to
do a service to literature.</p>

<p>The great difficulty is to recognize
literature when it first comes in at the
door, for one quality of literature is that
it is not likely even to know itself. The
one thing that is certain is that the critical
crew and the academic faculty are
sure not to recognize it at first sight.
To know its royal qualities at once under
strange and new garments—that is to be
a great publisher, and the glory of that
achievement is as great as it ever was.</p>

<p class="hang"><i>A Popular Illusion Based on “Graustark” and
“David Harum” Dispelled—Publishers Blunder
More Often in Welcoming Than in Rejecting
Manuscripts of the “New Man”—Guess Work
Enters Largely Into the Fate of a Novel—How
Publishers Judge Manuscripts and How “Reading”
Is Done.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>It will probably always be believed by
many persons that publishing houses do
not give careful attention to book manuscripts
that come from strangers. The
case of “David Harum” did much to fix
this notion in the public mind. The
manuscript was declined by three or
four publishers before it was accepted by
the Appletons. Its declination was an
evidence of bad financial book-judgment,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80">80</a></span>
but it is not proof that it was
carelessly considered. Most publishers’
readers are literary folk, pure and simple.
Not one in a hundred has a good
financial judgment of a manuscript. As
a literary product, judged by academic
standards, there was not much in “David
Harum” to commend it. The publishers
who rejected it acted on the readers’
reports. When it went to the Appletons,
somebody was shrewd enough to
see that if it were shortened and put in
somewhat better form, it would have a
commercial value. A publishing judgment
was passed on it there and not
merely a conventional literary judgment.</p>

<p>Or, take the case of “Graustark.” It
was declined at least by one publisher.
There is, perhaps, not a “literary”
reader in the world who would have
commended it in manuscript, or (for
that matter) who will commend it now.
It does violence to every literary canon.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81">81</a></span>
But a Chicago publisher, by some divine
or subterranean suggestion, saw a
chance for it. Its roughest edges were
hewn off with an axe, and it was put
forth. There have now appeared four
“Graustark” books, three of which have
each sold perhaps a hundred times as
many copies as Mr. Howell’s latest novel
will sell.</p>

<p>The difference between a mere literary
judgment and a publishing judgment indicates
the greatest weakness in the organizations
of most publishing houses.
The publisher himself is usually a business
man. He has to concern himself
with the financial work of his house—with
the manufacture and the sale of
books. In a great measure he relies, for
his judgment of literary values, on his
advisers and readers. As a rule these
advisers and readers are employed men
or women. They know nothing about
what may be called the commercial
value of books. Many of them know<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82">82</a></span>
nothing about the losses or the profits on
the books that they have commended.
They have had no experience in selling
books. These facts indicate the wrong
organization of most publishing houses.
Yet the faithfulness that they show to aspiring
authors is amazing; they plough
conscientiously through thousands of
manuscripts looking for the light of
some possible genius, and they commend
dozens of books where their employers
accept a single volume.</p>

<p>But the publisher does acquire a sort
of sixth sense about a book. He may or
he may not know literary values, but he
comes to have a peculiar sort of knowledge
of the commercial possibilities of
books. If he takes “literary readers’”
judgments and does not read
manuscripts himself, he will now and
then let a “David Harum” pass through
his hands. To avoid such mistakes
every publishing house has at least two
readers, and these read manuscripts independently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83">83</a></span>
of one another. The publisher
then makes his judgment from
them both, or perhaps from a third reading
by a specialist, if the manuscript
seem good enough to warrant a third
reading.</p>

<p>The mistake of permitting a profitable
manuscript to be rejected does not come,
therefore, from inattention to the work
of strangers, but from sheer fallibility of
judgment. And the work of strangers
is very carefully considered in every
publishing house that I know anything
about. Every publisher in these days is
just as eager to get a new good writer on
his list as any unknown writer is eager to
get a publisher; and no manuscript
above the grade of illiteracy is neglected.</p>

<p>A “first reader”—a man of all around
general knowledge of books, and he
ought to be a man full of hard common-sense,
common-sense being worth more
than technical literary knowledge—the
“first reader” examines the manuscript.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84">84</a></span>
If it be a shopworn piece of commonplace
work, obviously hopeless, he may
not read it from preface to end, but he
must say in his written report whether
he has read it all. Whether he condemn
it or approve it, it is examined or read by
another reader. If both these condemn
it as hopeless, the publisher declines it
without more ado.</p>

<p>The greater number of manuscripts
that come to publishing houses are hopeless.
Three-fourths of them, or more,
are novels that have been written by
lonely women or by men who have no
successful occupation; and most of
these are conscious or unconscious imitations
of recent popular novels. It does
not require very shrewd judgment to see
that they are hopeless. But it does require
time. If they are above the grade
of illiteracy somebody must read a hundred
pages or more to make sure that
the dulness of the early chapters may
not be merely a beginner’s way of finding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85">85</a></span>
his gait. And many of these manuscripts
go from publishing house to publishing
house. There are, I should say, a
thousand hopeless novels in manuscript
at all times making this weary journey.</p>

<p>Sometimes one comes back to the
same publisher a second time, the author
having perhaps not kept an accurate
record of its itinerary. Sometimes it
comes back a year later, somewhat
changed. There is one novel-manuscript
that has come to me four times within
two years, every time in a somewhat
different form, and twice with different
titles—obviously to fool the “careless”
publisher.</p>

<p>While very few mistakes are made or
are likely to be made with these manuscripts
that two readers independently
declare hopeless, the class next to these
require a great deal of work and care.
This class includes those books by unknown
writers that are not bad. One
reader will say that they are worth considering.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86">86</a></span>
The next reader will say that
they have some sort of merit. Then the
publisher must go slowly. A third person
must read them. If the publisher be
an ideal publisher, he will read them
himself. (The weakness of most American
publishing houses of this generation
comes just here—the publisher himself
does not read many manuscripts.)</p>

<p>In the best publishing houses (this, I
know, is the habit of three) the reports
on books of this class are all read at a
meeting of the firm, or (better) at a
meeting of the firm and of the heads of
departments. At such a meeting the
judgment of a sensible man who is at the
head of the sales department of a publishing
house is very useful. He knows
by his everyday work what sort of books
the public is buying. Some of them are
books that the “literary” world knows
nothing about or has forgotten.</p>

<p>And three or four or five men, by a
little discussion, can reach a clearer and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87">87</a></span>
saner judgment about a book from the
reports of three or four readers than the
readers themselves can reach or than
any one man or any two men who consider
the reports could reach. There is
no subject in the world about which a
conference is likely to be more helpful.
One man’s judgment about the publishing
quality of a book may easily be
wrong. The judgment of two men may
be wrong if they look at it from the same
angle or with the same temperament.
But the judgment of three, or four, or
five men, if they have the facts before
them and if they indulge in frank discussion,
is very seldom wrong. No book
on which serious work has been done
ought to be rejected or accepted without
the benefit of the independent reports of
two or three sensible persons who have
carefully read it, and without the discussions
of these reports by three or four
other persons of experience and judgment.
And in at least three American<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88">88</a></span>
publishing houses every manuscript of
any value or promise runs a course of
hopeful consideration such as this; for
the publisher wants good new books, he
wants good new writers; and he wants
them badly. Half a dozen popular
writers will build a publishing house.
It is, therefore, doubtful whether any
other business is so carefully conducted
with reference to its sources of supply.</p>

<p>In fact, all publishers make many
more mistakes in accepting books than
in declining them. They accept many
books from new writers that they hope
may possibly succeed, but in which they
have not very strong faith. It is the
book manuscripts of this class that
cause the most work and the greatest
trouble—the class that may possibly
succeed. A book of this class by a new
writer who shows cleverness or some
other good quality is often accepted in
the hope that the author may do better
with the next book. It is accepted as an<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89">89</a></span>
encouragement and as a hope; it chiefly
is for this reason that so many books are
published that are barely good enough
to warrant publication. The publisher
is trying to “develop” an author.</p>

<p>Sometimes this method succeeds; for
it sometimes happens that a good writer
writes a first book that is merely a promise
of later achievement. But this does
not often happen. In most cases the second
book is no better than the first—or
is worse. Then the publisher loses and
the writer is seldom heard of again. The
number of one-novel writers scattered
over the land would surprise the world if
it were known. There is no rule about
literary production to which there are
not an embarrassing number of exceptions.
But in most cases a successful
writer starts with a successful book.
The hope that the second book will be
better is one of the rocks on which many
publishing ventures wreck.</p>

<p>But if the publishers put forth a number<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90">90</a></span>
of commonplace books (chiefly
novels) from a false hope that they may
thus develop good writers, they also do a
service of the opposite kind. They save
the long-suffering public from many
worthless books. For if the public had
thrust upon it all or half or a tenth of the
books that are written, what a dull
world we should have!</p>

<p>When a book-manuscript has been rejected,
the delicate task comes next of
informing the author. This task is
seldom done as well as it ought to be. It
is almost impossible for a publisher—who
receives and rejects manuscripts as
a matter of business—to put himself in
the place of a writer who has spent
lonely weeks in her work. To send a
mere business note is almost an insult.
Yet what more can the publisher write?
He does not dare write hopefully. If he
does he will give a degree of encouragement
that is dishonest. Yet the author
expects a long and explicit letter telling<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91">91</a></span>
why the manuscript is unavailable. If
she does not receive such a letter she
jumps to the conclusion that her manuscript
has not had fair consideration.
Publishers’ letters of rejection are the
chief cause, I suspect, of the persistent
notion that they are careless in the examination
of manuscripts.</p>

<p>Every letter of declination ought to be
written by a skilful man—a diplomatist
who can write an unpleasant truth without
offence. Every such letter ought to
be written with a pen. No general form
ought to be used. Yet in only one of the
publishing houses whose habits I know
is this degree of care taken. The consideration
of manuscript from strangers
is careful and conscientious, but letters
of rejection are often perfunctory.</p>

<p>To sell a novel that has the mysterious
quality of popularity in it is not difficult.
Properly launched, it sells itself. To sell
a novel that lacks the inherent quality of
popularity—that is almost impossible.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92">92</a></span>
Apparently it has sometimes been done,
but nobody can be sure whether the
result after all was due to the book or
to the salesman. Every publisher has
proved, over and over again, to his disgust,
that he cannot make the people
buy a novel that they do not want; and
when a novel appears (no better novel)
that they do want, the novel-readers
find it out by some free-masonry and
would buy it if the publishers tried to
prevent them.</p>

<p>Nobody has discovered a rule—to say
nothing of a principle—whereby the
popularity of a novel by a new writer
may be determined. If it be a really
great, strong book, of course it is easy to
understand that it will sell; but whether
it will sell 10,000 copies or 100,000 nobody
knows. If it be a slapdash dime-novel,
full of action, it is easy to guess
that it will sell; but whether 5,000 or
500,000 nobody knows. Sometimes a
book of the sheerest commonplace happens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93">93</a></span>
to hit the public mood at the happy
angle and sells beyond all expectation.
The truth is, every new novel by an unknown
writer presents a problem peculiar
to itself; and in advertising it and offering
it for sale, every book’s peculiar
problem must be studied by itself.</p>

<p>The whole question is a subtle social
one. Who could have foretold popularity
for “pigs in clover,” rather than for
some other silly puzzle; or for ping-pong;
or for women’s hats of a certain
grotesque construction? The popular
whim about novels is like the whims for
these things. And a popular novel
passes as quickly as any other fashion.
The story has been many times told of
the sudden falling off of the demand for
“Trilby”—so sudden that the publishers
had a large number of copies left on
hand which could not be sold at all except
as waste paper. Every publisher is
afraid to publish very large editions of
any very popular novel; for they have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94">94</a></span>
all had an experience parallel to this experience
with “Trilby.”</p>

<p>But other kinds of books are less
capricious than novels; and the business
of the publisher has been reduced more
nearly to a science in dealing with books
of information. Several publishers, for
example, have series of little books
made of selections from English and
American classics. Many of them have
sold well; but some of them have sold by
the million and others just as good and
just as attractive have stopped at the
ten-thousand limit or at a lower limit.
The difference is with the skill with
which they were put on the market.
Sometimes an ingenious “scheme” will
sell information books in great numbers;
and it often happens that the worst of
three or four books on the same subject
and published for the same price, becomes
far better known than the other
better books.</p>

<p>As a theoretical proposition it seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95">95</a></span>
plain that the publisher who will spend
the most money in newspaper advertising
will sell the most books. Authors
not infrequently take up this notion.
Sometimes it is true; for sometimes
newspaper advertising will cause a great
demand for a book. But this is not true
with every book. And most recent publishing
failures have been due—in a
great measure, at least—to prodigal advertising—or,
perhaps, to misdirected
advertising.</p>

<p>Every book is a problem unto itself.
The wise publisher so regards it from the
beginning; and he makes his plans for
every book to suit its peculiar case and
not another. All the long road from
author to reader, the book—any book—presents
a series of interesting, original
problems. Many of them are very fascinating
problems. They call for imagination,
fertility, ingenuity. The
reason why few authors or authors’
societies or other persons who have not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96">96</a></span>
been definitely trained to publishing
fail, is that they are too likely to regard
publishing as a mere routine business—a
business of manufacturing a certain product
and then of offering it for sale.
They forget that every book—and even
every edition of every book—presents a
problem that was never presented before
since the world was made. And
when its sympathetic ingenuity and inventiveness
fail, a publishing house begins
to become a mere business and the
drying-up period is not far off.</p>

<p>But no publishing house fails because
it does not examine manuscripts carefully.
There is no other business that I
know of that is done more seriously; and
the mistakes made are fewer than the
public thinks. They are mistakes of
judgment and not of carelessness.</p>

AT THE AUTHOR’S EXPENSE</span></h2>

<blockquote>

<p class="hang"><i>A Heartless Pirate Who Preys Upon the Unsophisticated
and Ambitious Writer—The Contract
in Which This Sort of “Publisher” Cannot
Lose—The Inevitable Disappointment—How
the Publication by Even a Responsible
House of a Book That Sells Poorly Injures the
House.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>An innocent and ambitious good
woman sent to me last year a form of
contract that a printer who pretended
to be a publisher had sent her to
sign for the publication of a novel. In
its unessential clauses it was like the
usual publisher’s contract; but it required
the author to pay in advance a
fixed sum for the plates and for the
manufacture of one thousand copies;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100">100</a></span>
and this sum was just about twice what
they should cost him. Then he was to
pay her not the usual ten or even fifteen
per cent. royalty, but fifty per cent. on
all copies sold—as well he might; and,
if at the end of a year the book had
ceased to sell, she was bound to buy the
plates from him at half cost. The
meaning of all this translated into
figures, is this: The plates would cost
him $250, for he does cheap work; a
thousand copies of the book would cost
him $200, for he makes cheap books;
total, $450. She would pay him in advance
$900. He has a profit so far of
$450. He does not expect to sell any
of the books. Her friends would buy
perhaps as many as two hundred copies.
They would not be on sale at the bookstores—except
in her own town. At
the end of the year she would pay him
again for the plates half what he charged
her at first—which is just what they
cost him. By this time she would have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101">101</a></span>
paid just three times their cost to him.
His outlay in the whole transaction
would be:</p>

</table>

<p>He would not have even to make any
outlay of capital. She supplies the capital
and he makes his $700 profit by
writing her a few letters. If any of the
books were sold he would receive also
half what they brought. She would
have spent $1150, less what she received
for the few copies that were sold.
Her book would not have been published—only
printed at an excessive
cost.</p>

<p>There are several “publishers” who
seem to do a prosperous brief business
of this kind by preying upon inexperienced<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102">102</a></span>
and disappointed authors. It
is only by accident they ever get a book
that sells; and they hardly pretend to
put books on the market, for of course
the booksellers will not buy them. A
really good book would, therefore, in
their hands be buried. The public
would never find it out. They print a
large number of the novels that the real
publishers decline.</p>

<p>The long list of books—chiefly novels—that
these pseudo-publishers put out
tells a sad tale of misdirected energy
and of disappointed hopes. A man—oftener
it is a woman—conceives the
notion of writing a novel. She works
alone. She shuts herself off from life
about her. Any human being who
spends months at a self-imposed secret
task becomes profoundly, even abnormally
interested in it. The story grows—or
flows; for the author becomes
more fluent as she goes on. She is likely
to accept all the stories of extraordinary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103">103</a></span>
successes that she reads in the literary
journals as if they were common successes.
She goes on working by herself
with no corrective companionship. At
last she sends it to a real publisher and
gets a disappointing decision. She
imagines a thousand reasons why she is
not appreciated. She sends it to another,
and so on. The story of the
wanderings of “David Harum” in manuscript
has given courage to thousands
of worthless novels—a courage to travel
to the last ditch, and the last ditch is the
pseudo-publisher. “Yes,” he writes,
“it is an unusual story;” and he will
be greatly honored to publish it, and
sends one of his remarkable contracts.</p>

<p>To get the book published by anybody
will bring her recognition, she
thinks. The public will be kinder than
the publishers. She takes the risk—sometimes
goes into debt to do so. That
is the end of the book, and in most cases
the end of the author’s career. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104">104</a></span>
work begun in loneliness has ended in
oblivion—wasted days, wasted dollars,
wasted hopes.</p>

<p>Yet what is an author to do who believes
in his own work when it is refused
by the regular publisher? Publish it
himself or let it remain in manuscript.
Never permit it to be brought out by a
publisher to whom any suspicion attaches.</p>

<p>There is not much danger (I do not
believe there is any danger) that a manuscript
of any value whatever will under
present conditions fail to find a legitimate
purchaser. But one way out of
the difficulty that authors often seek is
to propose to a legitimate publisher to
publish his book at the writer’s expense;
and it is not apparent to the
layman why the publisher cannot afford
to make such arrangements. “If the
author pays the bill,” he says, “the publisher
will surely lose nothing.” But the
publisher does lose, and loses heavily,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105">105</a></span>
every time he publishes a book that is
not successful in the market. A publisher
cannot afford to accept a book
that will not itself earn a profit. If the
author pay all the cost and a good
profit besides, even this does not change
the case; for unsalable books clog the
market and stop the wheels of the publisher’s
whole trade. He soon begins to
lose influence and standing in the book
trade. The jobbers buy new books
from him in smaller quantities. The
booksellers become suspicious of his
judgment.</p>

<p>Last year, to give a true instance, a
publisher put out four new novels by
four new writers. His salesmen and his
advertising man announced them as
good books. They made enthusiastic
estimates of them. The book dealers
ordered liberally. Three out of the
four failed to make any appreciable
success. The dealers had many copies
of them left on hand. This year, when<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106">106</a></span>
the same publisher brought out two
more new novels by two more new
writers, his salesmen met with incredulity
and indifference. The booksellers
said to them with a sad smile, “We’ll
swap copies of your last year’s novels
for these.”</p>

<p>Now it so happens that both of these
new books of this year are good and
popular. A demand for them was made
as soon as the reviews appeared and
people began to read them. But the
booksellers were ill supplied. They
would order only a few copies at a time—or
none. Thus the good books of this
year suffered because the publisher’s
dull books of last year failed to bring
profit or satisfaction to anybody. They
stood in the way of this year’s better
books.</p>

<p>While, therefore, no legitimate publisher
wishes to reduce his business to a
mere commercial basis, and while he is
eager to maintain the dignity of his profession—must<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107">107</a></span>
maintain it in fact—and
do as high service as possible to the
literary production of his time; yet he
cannot load down his list with many
books that have not a good commercial
reason for existence.</p>

<p>The plausible proposition which is so
often made in these days of universal
authorship—to publish books at the
author’s expense—is for these reasons
not a sound proposition. If the book
succeeds there is no reason why the
author should make the investment.
If it fail, the publisher loses, even though
the author settle the bill; and he loses
heavily.</p>

<p>A writer who asks a publisher to
bring out a book that has no commercial
reason for existence is asking him
to imitate the “fake” publisher. The
“fake” publisher could not make a living
(since he has no character and cannot
sell books) except by cash payments
from his authors. As soon as the publisher<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
begins to receive cash payments
from his authors (be the basis ever so
legitimate) he begins to clog up the outlets
for his product. He has taken the
first step towards “fake” publishing.</p>

<p>In a word, commercially unprofitable
books may be printed, but they cannot
be published without ruining the machinery
that they are run through. He
is the best publisher who has the largest
proportion of good books on his list
(whether his list be long or short) that
are at the same time alive in the
market.</p>

<p>There are—let it be said as an exception—a
few classes of books that every
publisher wishes to have on his list in
spite of the fact that they cannot be
made profitable, such as works of great
scholarship or monumental works that
have a lasting value. It is legitimate
that the writers or the societies or organizations
under whose directions such
books were written should pay or share<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109">109</a></span>
the cost of their manufacture. But few
such works yield a profit at last to either
publisher or author. And they are not
made to clog the book market. They
are sold only to special classes of readers.</p>

<p>A book is a commodity. Yet the moment
it is treated as a mere commodity
it takes severe revenge on its author and
on its publisher.</p>

<p>These pseudo-publishers sometimes
solicit manuscripts from ignorant writers.
They have veiled advertisements
in the literary journals. Ignorance and
ambition is a susceptible combination.
Several years ago one of these plausible
swindlers bribed a reader in one of the
larger publishing houses to report to
him the names of all the writers whose
novels were declined there. The fakir
then plied them with circulars and
letters.</p>

<p>While I have been writing about publishing
swindles I have been reminded
of the accusation brought several years<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110">110</a></span>
ago against publishers—especially English
publishers—that the temptation to
fraud was too strong to be resisted by
any but the most upright and successful
men. An author gives his book to his
publisher. Twice a year the publisher
makes a report—pays royalties on the
number of books that he has reported as
sold. There is no way whereby the
author can verify the publisher’s reports.
He has to take his word for it.
Even if the author or someone who
acted for him were to see the publisher’s
books, he could learn nothing, for the
publisher’s bookkeeping is a very complicated
thing; and reports of book
sales could easily be “doctored.”</p>

<p>The chance for fraud does exist. But
the first wish of every normal man in the
business, even if he lacks vigorous honesty,
is to make his reports of sales to
his author as large as possible. This
wish is too strong to be overcome by
anything less than the most hopeless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111">111</a></span>
moral depravity. A publisher who
should commit the crime of making
false reports to his authors would be a
monstrosity. Yet the contention that
Sir Walter Besant made in England for
so many years, that the publishing business
was conducted without such checks
and verifications as are applied to other
business transactions was true; and I,
for one, see no practical remedy for it.</p>

<p>Moral: Select your publisher with
care; make sure that he is honest (by
far most of us are); then trust him.
But steer clear of all “fake” publishers
and “agents.”</p>

<p>About the advertising of books, nobody
knows anything. The most that
can be said is that some publishers are
making very interesting experiments.
But nobody has yet worked out a single
general principle that is of great value.
The publishers themselves frankly confess
that they do not know how to advertise
books—except a few publishers
who have had little experience.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116">116</a></span>
The fundamental difficulty of course
is that hardly any two books present the
same problem. Find a successful advertising
plan for one book—it will not
be a good plan for another. This fundamental
difficulty marks the difference,
for instance, between books and shoes.
When a shoe merchant finds out by experiment
how to describe his shoes and
in what periodicals to print his description,
his problem is solved. Recently
several publishers discovered a successful
way to advertise a novel. They
tried the same plan with another novel
and another. But it’s hit or miss. I,
for one, would give much to know how
often it has been “miss.”</p>

<p>The old-fashioned way was to insert
a brief, simple, dignified announcement
of every book, as is still done in The
Spectator, of London, for example.
Good; but such an announcement
doesn’t go far. A very few thousand
persons see it. They wait until the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117">117</a></span>
books are reviewed or till some friend
or authority speaks about them. For
this perfectly good reason some publishers
do not insert many advertisements
in those publications that go only to the
literary class—they are to a degree superfluous.
Those that are inserted are
inserted to give the publishers and the
books a certain “standing,” and to
keep pleasant the relations between the
publishers and these journals.</p>

<p>Then come, of course, the monthly
popular magazines. They reach a very
much wider class of readers, and to advertise
books in them is a logical procedure.
But their advertising rates are
almost prohibitory. The margin of
profit on books is very small. There
is not money enough in the business to
warrant extensive and expensive magazine
advertising. The result is the publishers
put their announcements of perhaps
a dozen new books on a single advertising
page of the magazines, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118">118</a></span>
they cannot, in this restricted space,
say enough about any particular book
to make the advertisement effective.</p>

<p>Then there are the daily papers. One
or two of the best dailies in every large
city are used by the publishers for announcements
of new books. They cannot
afford more—except in the case of
those novels which may reach enormous
editions. Given a novel that will sell
100,000 copies or more, and you have
enough possible profit to warrant a
good deal of advertising. But during
this calendar year only two novels (perhaps
three) have new editions of more
than 100,000 copies. What is a publisher
to do, then, who has a novel that
will sell 10,000 copies, or 20,000 copies
and no more? Can he make it sell
50,000 or 100,000 by spending a large
sum in advertising it? Perhaps, once
in ten times, or once in twenty times;
but not oftener.</p>

<p>Five or six publishing houses spend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119">119</a></span>
more than $50,000 a year, each, in advertising.
Two spend a good deal more
than this sum; and one is reported as
saying that he spends $250,000. These
are not large sums when compared with
the sums spent for advertising other
wares. But an advertisement of a shoe
published to-day will help to sell that
shoe next year. The shoemaker gets a
cumulative effect. But your novel advertised
to-day will be dead next year.
You get no cumulative effect. When
I say, therefore, that no publisher has
mastered the art of advertising books,
I tell the literal truth. They all run
against a dead wall; and they will all
tell you so in frank moments.</p>

<p>The study of the problem of advertising
books takes one far afield. What
quality in a book makes it popular anyhow?
Even if you are wise enough to
know that (and you are very wise if you
do know that) the question arises
whether advertising is necessary. There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120">120</a></span>
have been as many popular books sold
in large editions without advertising as
with it. If your book is really popular
it may sell anyhow. I could make a
long list of such books, and a still longer
list of books that extensive advertising
did not sell—books which seemed to
their publishers to have the quality of
great popularity.</p>

<p>The question carries us further back
still. Let us take the analogy of the
shoemaker again. He has shoe stores
within reach of the whole population.
There is not a village in the land where
there is not a store in which shoes are
sold. The manufacturers’ salesmen find
this distributing machinery ready to
their hands. If a man in Arkansas or
in Montana or in Florida wants a pair of
shoes, he is within reach of a place where
he may buy them. Not so with books.
There are few bookstores. Two or
three per cent. of the population (perhaps
less) live within convenient reach<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121">121</a></span>
of bookshops. True, a book may be
ordered by mail. But so may a pair of
shoes. But this is not a good substitute
for a store, where a man may see the
book. The mail-order business will
always be secondary to direct sales.
But, since bookstores are so few, the
book-distributing machinery is wholly
inadequate. The publisher has no effective
way yet to reach his normal public
with his wares.</p>

<p>There is nobody to blame, perhaps.
Surely, it would not be a profitable
undertaking for any man or woman to
buy a stock of books and to open a store
in a small town. What is the remedy,
then?</p>

<p>The simple truth is, here is one of the
problems of distribution that have not
yet been solved. There are throughout
the land another one hundred thousand
persons who would buy any novel of
which one hundred thousand have been
sold, if they could see the book and hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122">122</a></span>
about it—if it were intelligently kept
for sale where they would see it. This
is a self-evident proposition. But nobody
has yet found a way thus to distribute
a book. And (this is the point) until
better distributing machinery is organized,
it will not pay publishers to advertise
with as prodigal a hand as shoemakers
and soapmakers use in making
their wares known.</p>

<p>It is this lack of proper distributing
machinery that has made possible the
career of the book-agent. There are no
shoe peddlers. Almost all the publishing
houses—all the important houses—employ
book peddlers. The business is
generally regarded as a—nuisance, to say
the most for it. But, from the publisher’s
point of view, it is a necessity. And
this is the crude way whereby it is
sought to remedy the radical deficiency
of proper distributing machinery. Of
course, the book-agent method has its
obvious disadvantages. It is not a dignified<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123">123</a></span>
occupation, as most agents practise
it. The most dignified members of
the community, therefore, do not take
it up. In every case it is not even the
trustworthy members of the community
that take it up. Again, the agent must
be paid; and this is a very costly
method (to the purchaser) of buying
books. The purchaser pays half his
money for the books; the other half for
being persuaded to buy them.</p>

<p>And (to take a broad, economic view
of the subject) the book peddler surely
cannot be considered the final solution
of the problem of a proper distribution
of books. At some time in the future,
when the country is three or four times
as densely settled as it now is, there will
be book stores in all towns. There may
still be need for the persuasiveness of
the agent, for some of the most successful
of them now do their best work in
cities within sight of good book shops.
But the point is, few book-agents sell<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124">124</a></span>
new books, and few of them sell single
books: they usually sell books in sets.
The problem, therefore, of the proper
distribution of the four or five really
good books that my publishing house
has put out this fall still remains unsolved
and, though I advertised them
in all magazines and newspapers, I
should not effectively reach the attention
of one-fifth or one-tenth of the possible
buyers of them. I should simply
spend in advertising the profit that I
may make on the copies that I sell with
a reasonable publicity through the regular
channels. I do insert advertisements
of them for three or four reasons—with
the hope of helping their sales; to keep
the public informed of the activity of our
publishing house; to please the press;
and—to please the authors of the books.
But I know very well that I am working
(as every publisher is working) in a business
that has not yet been developed,
that is behind the economic organization<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125">125</a></span>
of other kinds of manufacturing and selling,
that awaits proper organization.</p>

<p>Figure it out yourself. Here is a
book of which eighty thousand copies
have been sold through “the trade;”
that is, through the book stores. Our
salesmen have visited every important
bookseller from Portland, Me., to Portland,
Ore., and from Duluth to New
Orleans. We have spent quite a handsome
sum in advertising it. Four-fifths
of these eighty thousand copies were
sold in a few months after its publication.
The booksellers said that they
could sell many more if we would advertise
it more. We did so. By this
time our salesmen were making another
trip. No, they would not buy more,
thank you; it is a little slow now. The
second effort at advertising did not
cause it to “move” in the market. The
demand is slow yet. In other words,
the demand for it that could be supplied
by the existing book stores was practically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126">126</a></span>
exhausted. Our second advertising
effort was a waste of money. We
have frankly to confess that we do not
know how to sell more copies of this
book until the time comes when it may
be put into a “set” and sold by book
agents. This is the same as to say that,
the few existing book stores utilized,
there is no organized machinery for finding
more buyers except the book agent.</p>

<p>Yet it is obvious that a wholesome
book (as this is) which eighty thousand
persons have bought would please eighty
thousand other persons of like minds
and taste if we had any way to find these
second eighty thousand persons. They
exist, of course. But they live out of
easy reach of the book stores. The
book agents will find them several years
hence.</p>

<p>I have (I think) shown why there can
never be a publishers’ trust, or “combine,”
because the relation of the publisher
and the author is a personal relation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127">127</a></span>
as intimate and personal as the relation
of a physician to his patient or of a
lawyer and his client. But, after a book
has been sold and has become a commodity,
the problem is a different one.
The booksellers have perceived this;
and they have made ineffective efforts
to “combine.” They have failed because
they have not made plans to widen
the existing market. An organization
of those that exist is not enough. The
real problem is to extend their area, to
find book-buyers whom they do not now
reach.</p>

<p>Perhaps all this is very dull—this
trade talk. But a publisher who is
worthy of his calling regards himself as
an educator of the public; and he has
trade reasons and higher reasons as well
for wishing to reach as many buyers of
his good books as he possibly can. He
knows (and you know, if you know the
American people) that the masses even
of intelligent folk have yet hardly fairly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128">128</a></span>
begun to buy books. Go where you
will among the people and you will find
few books—pitifully few. We are just
coming into a period when book-buying
is even beginning to become general.
The publishers of a generation hence will
sell perhaps ten times as many good
books as are sold now—surely, if they
find in their day distributing machinery
even half adequate.</p>

Step of the Way Beset with Expense, So
That the Publisher Is Amazed When He Finds
a Surplus—Why Books of Large Sale Are Hard
to Get—The Publisher as Anxious as the Public
to Print Better Books.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>The wonder is (and in my mind it
grows every year) how the publishers of
books make enough money to keep their
shops going. When I look at my own
ledgers (ledger, by the way, is become a
mere literary word, for we now all keep
accounts on cards and not in books)—whenever
I look at my own cards and
see a profit, I am astonished as much as
I am gratified. Every other publisher in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132">132</a></span>
America, if he have a normal and simple
mind such as fits the calling, has the
same emotion. Let me say, lest I appear
“simple” in another sense, that our
cards have, miraculously enough, generally
shown very satisfactory profits,
but the astonishment never becomes
less.</p>

<p>See what a long series of processes, or
adventures, if you will, a book must go
through between the writer and the
reader; every step costs money; and
the utmost possible profit is small. Suppose
it be a novel. “Book” means
“novel” these days in “literary” circles
and journals. Heaven bless our shallow
gabble called “reviews.” A novel comes
to the publisher in fairly good English.
The English doubtless is the author’s,
but the punctuation and capitals are the
“typewriter-lady’s” own. It must be
read by one person; and, if that person’s
report have a ray of hope, it must be
read by another; perhaps by a third.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133">133</a></span>
These “readers” cost money—alas! too
little money. They are generally literary
persons who have failed, and there is
something pathetic about their occupation.
Then, after two or three readers
have reported on it, I have to read it—in
our particular shop, in any shop,
somebody “higher up” must read it—especially
if it come from a new writer.</p>

<p>Then we have to correspond with the
author or have interviews with h—er.
All this takes time, and the cost of this
service rolls up. Somebody must next
go over the manuscript to prepare it for
the printer—to make sure that the
heroine’s name is spelt the same way all
through and so forth and so forth. With
the processes of manufacture I need not
weary you. Only I must say that a bad
manuscript can be put into legible type,
and that type cast into solid metal
blocks ready for the press with a rapidity
and cheapness that rank among the
mechanical wonders of the world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134">134</a></span>
By this time the artist has appeared,
if the novel is to be illustrated. Book
salesmen will tell you that pictures help
to sell novels, and they ought to know.
But I venture to say that you haven’t
seen three new novels in ten years whose
illustrations conveyed anything but confusion
to your mind. The conventional
illustration of the conventional novel
marks the lowest degradation of the
present-day publisher. We confess by
these things that we are without character
or conviction. But the artist has
the benefit of the commercial doubt on
his side. He has also the vanity of the
author. And he gets his fee—200, 300
or 500 good dollars or more—and the
publisher pays the bill. Another artist
makes a design for the cover.</p>

<p>Paper, printing, binding—all these
are commonplaces, worthy of mention
here only because they roll up the cost.
But there are other steps in the book’s
journey that the public knows less<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135">135</a></span>
about. For instance, as soon as the first
chapter has been put into type and a
cover made, “dummies” of the book are
got ready. A “dummy” of a book is a
sort of model, or sample, of it. The
cover is the cover that will appear on the
finished novel; the titlepage is the novel’s
titlepage; and the first chapter is as it
will be when the book is published.
But the rest is blank paper. This
“dummy” shows the physical size and
appearance of the book.</p>

<p>The travelling salesmen take these
dummies and begin their work. They go
to all the jobbers and book dealers, explaining
to them the charming qualities
of this newly discovered novelist, and
taking orders for the books. By the time
they come home and their advance
orders are added up, the book is ready
to go to press; and the publisher knows
what his “first sale” will be. Meantime
(not to lose the thread of my story) all
this travelling and soliciting of orders<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136">136</a></span>
have cost a good deal of money. The
public has not yet seen a copy of the
book nor even so much as heard of it nor
of the “talented young author.”</p>

<p>But now the machinery for publicity
is put in action. Sly little literary notes
about the book and the author begin to
appear in the newspapers. These, too,
have come from the publisher. From
whom else, pray, could they come? But
they mean that the publisher has to
maintain a literary bureau. The man
who writes these news notes and the advertisements
of the book and other
things about it is a man of skill, if he do
his work well; and he, too, costs the
publisher a good salary. When he begins
to put forth advertising—how much
shall he spend on this new novel by an
unknown writer? How much shall you
risk at Monte Carlo? Your upright man
will risk nothing at Monte Carlo. I have
sometimes thought that your upright
publisher, if there be one, would risk<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137">137</a></span>
nothing in advertising a new book by an
unknown writer, until the book began itself
to show some vitality in the market.</p>

<p>But—to go back—as soon as the book
is ready, review copies, of course, are
sent to the newspapers and the literary
journals (to appear a little later in the
second-hand book-shops for sale at reduced
prices.) All this activity requires
clerks, typewriters, bookkeepers, postage-money—a
large office, in fact.
There are many posters, circulars—there
is as much machinery required to
sell a book as to sell a piano or an automobile.</p>

<p>From the starting-point, where the
book was an ill-written manuscript, to
the delivery of it to the bookseller, the
publisher has less than 50 cents a copy to
pay for this whole journey and to save
something for profit if he can. Therefore
I say that publishers who do succeed
are among the most astute managers
of industry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138">138</a></span>
Lest I seem to “boast rather than to
confess,” I come back to the starting-point,
which was this—that the publishers’
calling is not a very profitable
one; not a profitable one at all except in
fair weather and with a good skipper.</p>

<p>The truth is, publishing is too important
a profession and our publishing
houses are too important as institutions
to be at the mercy of present conditions.
The making of schoolbooks and the
vending of standard old books in sets,
which are useful vocations, but are not
publishing proper, are now done best by
firms and companies that do nothing
else. Hence publishing proper—the
bringing out of new books—must find a
safer basis than the present conventional
profit. It will find this safer basis in two
ways.</p>

<p>The first and obvious way is to secure
books that have an enormous popularity.
This is the effort of nearly all the
publishing houses to-day. If a novel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139">139</a></span>
reach an edition of 100,000 copies, there
is a good profit in it as matters now
stand. And a novel, or other book, that
will be bought by 100,000 persons ought
not to be sold for more than such books
now fetch. But there are not enough
such books to go around; and the least
worthy publishing house is as likely to
secure them as the most worthy. A permanent
institution, therefore, cannot be
built on these or on the hope of them.
They are the accidents of the calling.</p>

<p>The other way to maintain a worthy
publishing institution is to publish
worthy books, to manufacture them
well, to do every piece of work that is
done on them or that is done for them in
the most conscientious way—to keep
bookmaking as a fine art, to keep bookselling
a dignified profession, to keep the
selection of books to publish on the high
level of scholarly judgment. This done,
a publisher may set his prices higher—must
set his prices higher, for he does a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140">140</a></span>
higher and more costly service to society.
Excellent and worthy of all praise
as is some of the publishing work of this
sort that is now done, a beginning has
hardly yet been made. There is a demand,
or a dormant demand can be
awakened, for books that have merit (I
mean new books as well as old) of better
manufacture than we now often see.
They must be sold for higher prices, of
course.</p>

<p>This is the same as to say that just as
a three-dollar shoe is made for most feet
that tread this weary continent, but a
five-dollar shoe is made for an increasing
number of feet that prefer ease to economy,
so we are becoming rich enough
and wise enough to pay two dollars, or
three dollars, or five dollars for a good
new book that shall have large and beautiful
type, good paper, good margins,
good binding—shall be a work of art in
its manufacture as well as in the quality
of its contents. The public gets its good<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141">141</a></span>
books too cheap; and the reason is plain.</p>

<p>It was only the other day that the
publishers discovered the possibility of
securing book after book that would run
into large editions. A novel-reading
democracy—a public-school democracy—is
a new thing. It is an impressive
thing. It made new and big markets,
and we all rushed after it. Cheapness
and great editions became the rage.
Writers wrote for the million; publishers
published for the million. Cheap
books became the fashion. All very
well—this widespread effort, this universal
reading. But it has not radically
changed human nature nor even the
permanent foundations of the profession
of publishing. We shall come back
to higher and better work—some of us
will, at least.</p>

<p>Bring the subject home to yourself.
What do you want for your book
money? Not the latest “big seller.”
You may buy that to entertain you on a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142">142</a></span>
railway journey. But if you bring it
home at all, you send it away at Christmas
to some country library. What you
want in your own library for your book-money
are good books, made at least as
well as the furniture in the room; and
you want the new books of permanent
value. You are sometimes disgusted
when you look over the publishers’ catalogues
to find so few books of this kind.</p>

<p>Your publishers, too, are becoming
weary of having such catalogues; and as
soon as we rediscover the old truth that
there is a permanent demand for just
the kind of books that you want, we
shall turn to a more generous encouragement
of them. Men who might do better
work will then cease trying to write
“best sellers.” But you must pay the
price. Since you have become accustomed
to buy new books at $1.50 a volume,
you are somewhat reluctant to pay
$2 or $4 for a new book. You must
break yourself of that habit. In a word,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143">143</a></span>
you must become at least as generous to
your publisher as you are to your shoemaker;
and then the change will take
place.</p>

<p>By a similar course of reasoning (and
it is sound) you may discover that you
are yourself to blame for what our writers
write and our publishers publish—in
a measure at least; and, whenever you
want better books, better books will be
ready for you. For the publisher and
even the author are but human after all;
and in the mood that has possessed us
all for a decade or two—since presses
and paper became so cheap—we have
perhaps worshipped mere numbers. I
have published some books only because
thousands and thousands of persons
would read them. You have read them
simply because thousands of other people
were reading them and for no better
reason. Perhaps our sins have not been
heinous. But, if you are so stubbornly
virtuous as to cry shame at me, I promise<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144">144</a></span>
you this: I will reform on the day
that you yourself reform; but you must
first signify repentance. For you—the
public—are after all our masters.</p>

Equipped with Good Books—Circulating Libraries

Source of Poor Sale of Books.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>How large the book market is, nobody
knows. Still less does anybody know
how large it may become, say, in another
decade of our present prosperity and
spread of intelligence. Beyond any
doubt more books are bought in the
United States than in any other country.
Yet it is a constant surprise to discover
how ill supplied the mass of the
people are with good books. But the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148">148</a></span>
enormous increase of the market in recent
years gives hope of a still greater increase
to come. The number of books
published every year in the United
States and in the United Kingdom is
about the same, but more American
than English books run to large editions.</p>

<p>Leaving out fiction, which is the spectacular
and sensational part of publishing,
books of reference, of standard
literature, of history, of applied science
and even of poetry are sold in constantly
increasing quantities. The public hears
little of these because the literary journals
pay little attention to them. There
is, for instance, one publisher of subscription
books who now adds few books
to his list of which he does not expect to
sell 100,000 copies. He has agents in
every part of the United States, and
they probably sell more books in a year
than all the publishing houses in the
United States put together sold thirty
years ago—excluding textbooks, of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149">149</a></span>
course. Last year a literary man went
to a remote railway station, 1,000 miles
from Boston or New York, to shoot
quail. One day he saw men unloading
boxes of books from a freight car on the
side track. The wonder was that there
should be even a freight car in that corner
of the woods; and that the freight
car should be filled with books was simply
incredible. But there were wagon
loads of Thackerays, of Dickenses, of
Eliots, and even of sets of the poets,
fairly well-printed, fairly well-bound
volumes which had been sold to the
country folk for miles around. Perhaps
there has been more money spent for
encyclopædias and dictionaries than
Noah Webster could compute, these last
ten years. The book market, therefore,
is very much bigger than persons who
live outside the book selling world are
likely to think.</p>

<p>Still, relatively it is small. The largest
retail book store in the country is a department<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150">150</a></span>
store in New York or Philadelphia;
but the book department is not
considered one of the important parts of
the store. The much-abused department
store, by the way, has done much
to bring a new class of persons to acquire
the book-buying habit. It has made
books common merchandise for the first
time. Since the “Century Dictionary,”
to take a definite example, was thus
made common merchandise, the sets of
it that have been sold are incomparably
more than were ever sold in any other
way. Yet how small the book market
yet is, is shown by this fact—that a novel
of which one hundred thousand copies
are sold reaches only one person in every
eight thousand of the population.</p>

<p>Do circulating libraries lessen book
sales? Yes, I dare say they do. But you
will find that the publishers do not complain
of them. They are disposed to accept
the comforting doctrine that everything
which encourages the reading of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151">151</a></span>
books in the end helps the sale of them.
In the end—yes. But for the moment
probably no.</p>

<p>One man will tell you that he used
regularly to buy a novel a week—sometimes
two novels. He was a pretty good
customer of the publishers; for fifty-two
novels a year is about as many as the
most avaricious publisher could reasonably
expect one man to buy. But now
he says he does not buy three a year. A
circulating library will for $5 bring him
all he wants. The publishers have,
therefore, lost him as a good customer.
On the other hand it is a working theory
that every subscriber to a circulating
library who reads a novel and talks
about it at the woman’s club may induce
somebody to buy a copy who otherwise
would never have heard of it. At any
rate, the total number of novels, or of
books of other sorts, now sold is not less
than the number that was sold before
the libraries found subscribers. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152">152</a></span>
discussion is, after all, a vain one. The
publisher and the author must do the
best they can by the help of the libraries
or in spite of them.</p>

<p>Yet I am sure that the great widening
of the market for which we are all looking
will be found, when it is found, not
by any special machinery or mechanical
device; but the person who will really
find it—or make it—will be a great
writer. Whenever books are written
that are interesting enough to compel
the attention of the whole people, the
poorest publishing house can sell them.
The secret of success, after all, is the
secret of writing books that touch
masses of men deeply and directly. We
have much to learn from the careers of
such books as “Progress and Poverty”
and “Looking Backward.” They
reached their great sale not by the ingenuity
of their publishers, nor by their
literary merit, but only because they
carried messages to many minds. However<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153">153</a></span>
delusive these messages may be,
they were sincere. The truth is that
the publisher (exalt him as I am trying
my best to do) is, after all, only a piece
of machinery. The real force that
makes itself felt in the world that has to
do with books is the initial force of the
men and women who write. Whenever
a great mind, or a great sympathy, be
found which puts forth an appeal or a
hope in the form of a book that has the
power to touch those emotions or aspirations
that all men have in common—then
the trick’s done. The mechanical
plans that we make have power to carry
only as far as the book has strength to
go. If I had five great living writers on
my list, my publishing task would be
easy.</p>

<p>For the broadening of the book market,
then, what we need is writers—writers
of the proper quality. Of
novels, we have enough and to spare,
such as they are. But not of good books<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154">154</a></span>
of other sorts. Let us take a hint from
the novel writers. Twenty years ago or
less the American public was amusing
itself with novels written by English
writers. But about that time came
those story tellers, a whole army of
them, who began to write about life in
different parts of our own country. Of
New England, Miss Jewett and Miss
Wilkins and Mrs. Austin and many
more; in the Middle West, Mr. Garland,
Mr. Churchill, Mr. Tarkington and half
a hundred more; in New York, the
author of “David Harum,” Mr. Frederick,
Mr. Bacheller and others; of the
South, Mr. Page, Miss Johnston, Miss
Glasgow and more; and there are California
stories in profusion. In other
words, an army of men and women began
about the same time to write stories
of local history and manners.</p>

<p>Now there are other subjects that
need to be written of just as much. One
such subject is science. The world is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
flooded with popular books about
science, but nearly all of them fail either
in being accurate or in being popular.
There is a better opportunity now than
there ever was before for a man who
really knows the most recent and scientific
achievements, and who can write in
the language of the people. To many
people, “authoritative books” are dry
books, but this is not what I mean. Such
books as I have in mind can be written
only by men of the best scientific equipment,
but they can be written only by
men who have also a great deal of literary
skill.</p>

<p>Another great subject about which
good books are needed is—you may not
believe this—American history. Our
political history has got itself pretty
voluminously written, and there is no
lack of slapdash books in distant imitation
of Green’s “Short History of the
English People.” But most of these
have been prepared out of newspaper<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156">156</a></span>
files by men who would not take their
task seriously or who were not well prepared
either in matured knowledge or in
literary skill to produce them. Then,
too, geographically considered, the history
of less than one-fourth of our territory
has not yet been written. Southern
history, for example, is utterly unknown.</p>

<p>It would be easy to name a half-dozen
other great subjects which writers who
now bring their manuscripts to the publishing
houses are neglecting. If, therefore,
men and women who have the literary
gift, even to a reasonable degree,
and who have literary ambition, would
frankly seek those two or three publishers
who are real publishers and would
prove their ability to do serious work of
this sort they would be almost sure to
find satisfactory careers before them.
Of course, one disadvantage of such
work is that during its early stages no
very large financial returns can be expected.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157">157</a></span>
But if the work were done well
enough it would pay in the end—pay
more money by far than a professorship
in science or in history or in literature
pays.</p>

<p>All this leads me to this general remark—that
the writing public does not
take the trouble to find out who the real
publishers are. There is a lack of coöperation
between publishers and writers
in what may be called the formative
period of the writer’s lives. A man who
writes a book sends it to some publishing
house that is chosen by accident or
by personal acquaintance or by whim.
The public seems to think that one publishing
house is as good as another. If a
writer’s first volume in this way falls
into the hands of a publisher who does
not make the acquaintance of the writer,
or who cannot make an appraisal of his
ability and promise, and who does not
understand him, then the writer, after
an initial failure, of course, becomes discouraged.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158">158</a></span>
On the other hand, all the
publishers are so eager to get books that
they accept work which is not properly
done, and on their part fail to put themselves
into such a relation to young
authors as would help them to their
normal development.</p>

<p>If a man or woman, therefore, proposes
to enter upon a literary career his
first duty is to make the acquaintance
of a real publisher, to be as frank with
him as one must be with one’s physician
or one’s lawyer. If two such men work
together seriously and without too great
haste the best results will be achieved
for both, and the best results are not
likely to come in any other way.</p>

<p>If you start, then, to gossip intelligently
about the book market or about
anything else with which a publisher
has to do, and if you gossip long enough,
you will come back to the starting point
of the whole matter. What do we do or
can we do to encourage the writing of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159">159</a></span>
good books? And now we’ve run on a
subject as deep as a well and as wide as a
door. In the multitude of counsellors
about it there is confusion. In the only
other “confession” that is to follow this
I shall try to show how ignorant and
mistaken all those are who differ with
me about this fundamental subject.</p>

<p>I am flattered by hearing that a
prominent publishing house wishes to
print these rambling “confessions” in a
pamphlet, to send to persons who write
books; “for,” says this house, “they
tell some plain facts that authors ought
to know.” I hope so; and, for my part,
I am not averse to publishers knowing
them either. For instance, the wretched
smallness of one sinner among the publishers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164">164</a></span>
came to light to-day. Here is
the unpleasant story:</p>

<p>A year and a half ago I published the
first novel by a young author. He is a
promising writer and his story was a
good one. We sold it in fairly satisfactory
numbers. We advertised it,
“exploited” it—did the best we could.
We invited the author to come and see
us. We took him into our confidence.
We have regarded him as our partner,
so far as his book is concerned. We
have had a continuous correspondence.
We have exchanged visits a time or two.
He paid me the compliment to ask my
advice about his next story. We have
become good friends, you see; and we
are as helpful to each other as we know
how to be. Now his second novel is
finished. In a letter that came from
him to-day he informed me that another
publishing house (I have a great mind
to write the name of it here) has made
him a very handsome offer of serial publication,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165">165</a></span>
provided, of course, that they
may also publish the book!</p>

<p>Now, if the young author wishes to go
browsing in these new pastures, I have
no power or wish to prevent him. I
cannot serve him—or do not care to
serve him—if he is unwilling that I
should. But I was nevertheless very
grateful when he wrote, “Of course, I
prefer you. I hope you have never
thought me unloyal.”</p>

<p>If publishing his first book had been
a mere job done under contract, a commercial
job and nothing more—that
would have been one thing. But that’s
not publishing. What I did was to
give the man the unstinted service of
our house, as publishers, as advisers, as
friends. We print and advertise and
sell his books—yes, to the very best of
our ability. But we do more. We try
to make friends for his book and for him
throughout the reading world. We all
take a personal interest in him and in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166">166</a></span>
his future. We invest our money, our
good will, our work, our experience, our
advice, our enthusiasm in him and in
his future. This service (except the investment
of money) is not a matter of
contract. It is a personal, friendly service.
If the service had not been successful,
he would have had a perfect
right to come and say that he feared
that we did not serve him well and to
go away from us. That would have
been frank and honorable. Even, since
we did succeed and have become friends,
he could still go to another publisher.
Yet, I maintain, if he had, he would
have shown himself a man of blunt
appreciation and dull honor. And the
publisher who tried to win him away
did a trick unworthy of the profession.</p>

<p>This is my last story about a publisher;
and the moral is plain, alike to
publisher and to author.</p>

<p>And now I will tell my last story<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167">167</a></span>
about an author, the moral of which also
is plain:</p>

<p>There is an author for whom we have
published two books, and they have
been uncommonly successful. A little
while ago he finished his third book.
He wrote that many publishers had solicited
it, that he had had several handsome
offers, that he needed a large sum
of money. Would we make a big advance
payment? He disliked to mention
the subject, but business was business
after all. Now I had been at that
man’s service for several years. Day
and night, he had sought my advice.</p>

<p>Well, we were cajoled into making a
big advance payment—about half as
big as he first asked for; and the contract
was signed. Two days later, I
met another publisher under conditions
which invited free and friendly talk;
and I told him this story. The publisher
smiled and declared that that
author had approached him and asked<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168">168</a></span>
how much he would give for this very
book!</p>

<p>Men and brethren, we live in a commercial
age. I suspect that, if we knew
history well enough, we should discover
that all ages have been commercial, and
that all our predecessors had experiences
like these. For ungrateful men have
written books for many a century, I
have no doubt; and we know that
Barabbas was a publisher. But let us
lift an honorable calling to an honorable
level. Hence these frank “confessions.”
And, if any publisher wishes to reprint
them to send to authors, or any author
to send to publishers, they both have
my permission. For dignity and honor
thrive best in an atmosphere of perfect
frankness.</p>

<p>Thinking over the behavior of authors
and publishers to one another, I am
obliged to confess that, while the peanut
methods that I have just described
are not common enough to cause us to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169">169</a></span>
despair, the truth is that the whole
business is yet somewhat unworthily
conducted. I mean that it is conducted
on too low a plane. For what
is it that we are engaged in?</p>

<p>The writers of good books are among
the greatest benefactors of society; and
the publishers of good books, if publishing
be worthily regarded and properly
done, is a necessary and complimentary
service. The publisher is the partner, the
helper of the author and his high servant
or minister to the people. It is work
worthy of large men and of high-minded
men. Honest men we are—those
of us who conduct the publishing
houses that are in good repute. But I
sometimes think that we miss being
large men; for we do not do our business
in (shall I say?) a statesmanlike
way. We imitate the manners of tradesmen.
We speak in the vocabulary of
tradesmen. We are too likely to look
at small projects as important—to pay<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170">170</a></span>
our heed to the mere tricks of our trade—and
to treat large enterprises, if we
have them, as if they were but a part
of the routine. A good book is a Big
Thing, a thing to be thankful to heaven
for. It is a great day for any of us when
we can put our imprint on it. Here is
a chance for reverence, for something
like consecration. And the man or the
woman who can write a good book is a
form of capital infinitely more attractive
than a large bank account or a great
publishing “plant.” Yet, if we regard
an author simply as “capital,” we are
not worthy to serve him. The relation
leads naturally to a friendly and helpful
attitude. We know something about
books, about the book-market, about
the public, that no author is likely to
know. With this knowledge we can
serve those that write. And with our
knowledge of the author and of his work,
we can serve the public. It is our habit
to keep our accounts with authors accurately,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171">171</a></span>
to pay them promptly, to receive
them courteously when they call,
to answer their letters politely and
sometimes to bore them with formal
dinners at our clubs, before they sail
for Europe. But how many of us really
know the intellectual life of any author
whose books we print and supply a
stimulus to his best plans?</p>

<p>And the authors? How little they
know about us or about publishing!
They seem to select publishers by whims
and not often by knowledge. I know a
writer of good books who is at this moment
seeking his third publisher. One
of the others failed. The other displeased
him. And now he is thinking
of giving his next book to a third publisher
who also will fail within five
years, or I am no prophet. Yet I am
hindered by courtesy from telling him
so. Why the man has not by this time
found a personality among the publishers
who has a soundly constructed business<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172">172</a></span>
and at the same time a helpful
intellectual appreciation of his work, I
cannot understand. He, too, is looking
at a great matter in a small way.</p>

<p>Therefore I am led to write down
these rules for an author to follow when
he looks for a publisher:</p>

<p>Find out whether the publishing
house that you have in mind be financially
sound. The commercial agencies
will tell you, or will tell any commercial
friend who may make inquiry for you.
And find out who the real owners of the
house are.</p>

<p>Then find out who conducts it. If it
is conducted by a lot of hired “literary”
men, avoid it. They are, most of them,
men who have failed at authorship;
they “read” and “advise” for salaries;
and most of them know nothing about
the houses that they serve. They are
not principals, but (as Henry George
once called them) “literary operatives.”
I mean to say nothing harsh about a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173">173</a></span>
well-meaning, hard-working class of
men. But if you have a good book, you
wish to find not a “literary operative,”
but a real publisher.</p>

<p>Having found a real publisher, you
will expect him to read your book himself.
I am assuming that you have an
important book. When he has read it,
he will talk to you about it frankly.
When I say frankly, I mean frankly. If
he is himself a real man and knows men
and books, he will not retail hack literary
phrases to you. He will talk good
English and good sense straight out of
his intelligence to your intelligence, with
no nonsense such as reviewers write in
the “literary” magazines. He will become
your intellectual friend.</p>

<p>Having found such a man, give him
your book and leave him to work out
the details of publishing. He will be
proud to serve you. You will discover
as your acquaintance ripens, that he has
your whole career as a writer in his mind<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174">174</a></span>
and plans. He will shape his whole
publishing activities to your development
and to the development of other
writers like you.</p>

<p>Then—if you are capable of writing
great books—you will discover that you
have set only natural forces at work for
your growth and for your publisher’s
growth; and the little artificial tricks of
the trade whereby a flashy story has a
“run”—into swift oblivion—will pass
from your mind and from his. You
will both be doing your best work.</p>

<p>After all, the authors of any generation
generally have the publishers that
they deserve to have; and this axiom
is reversible. For my part, while I am
as glad as Podunk, Exploitem &amp; Company
to have novels that will sell 100,000
copies, provided they give clean and
decent amusement, I take no permanent
interest in anything that comes this
month and goes the next; nor does any
serious man. My wish and aim is to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175">175</a></span>
become a helpful partner of some of the
men and women of my generation who
can, by their writings, lay the great
democracy that we all serve under obligations
to them for a new impulse. By
serving them, I, too, serve my country
and my time. And, when I say that
this is my aim and wish, I could say with
equal truth that it is the aim and wish
of every other real publisher. But, as
every good physician constantly wonders
at the ignorance and credulity of
otherwise sensible men who seek quacks,
so I wonder at the simplicity of many
respectable writers of books in seeking
publishers. Of downright quacks in the
publishing world, there are not many.
But there are incompetents a-plenty and
a fair share of adventurers.</p>

<p>We shall both—authors and publishers—get
the proper cue if we regard the
swarming, eager democracy all about us
as a mass of constantly rising men and
women, ambitious to grow, with the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176">176</a></span>
same higher impulses that we feel in our
best moods; and if we interpret our
duty as the high privilege of ministering
to these higher impulses and not to their
lower senses, without commercialism on
one side and without academicism on
the other, men among men, worthy
among the worthy, we may make our
calling under such a conception a calling
that leads.</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
